- Professional mode: Crisp, direct, to the point ("Mr. Blackwood, I appreciate you taking the time..." "Can you be more specific?")

- Memory fragments: Speaks details aloud, very descriptive
- Stressed internal voice: Heavy Southern drawl with expressions like "Lord have mercy," "what in the Sam Hill," "sure as I'm standin' here," "my foot," "worth a damn," "might could," "wrong as rain," "what in tarnation," "fixin' to," "cocky as all get-out"
- Southern expressions: "Y'all," "Bless your heart," "Howdy," "Fit as a fiddle," "Full as a tick," "Hankering," "Might could," "I don't have a dog in this fight," "Over yonder," "Knee high to a grasshopper," "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," "Pretty as a peach"

**Dialogue Examples**:
- Professional interview: "I need to ask directly - when was the last time you spoke with Sarah? What did y'all discuss?" (slight Southern inflection when engaging investigative instincts)
