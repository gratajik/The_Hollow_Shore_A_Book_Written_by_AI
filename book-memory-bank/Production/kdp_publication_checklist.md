### Series Description

For some investigators, the past is a crime scene. For Maya Chen, it's a ghost that follows her every step.

In the Detective Maya Chen series, every case is a journey into the shadows of memory and the chilling reality that some secrets refuse to stay buried. A survivor of childhood trauma that left her own past in fragments, Maya possesses a unique and haunting empathy for the victims she champions. Her sharp intellect and relentless drive are matched only by her vulnerability, as each investigation forces her to confront the echoes of her own forgotten history.

From the mist-shrouded islands of Maine to the darkest corners of the human psyche, Maya takes on the cases no one else will touch—the ones where the truth is not just hidden, but has been systematically erased. These are not just mysteries of murder and conspiracy, but deeply atmospheric, character-driven thrillers about the search for identity, the cost of justice, and the courage it takes to face the ghosts within.

### Book Description (Blurb)

*A remote island. A suppressed memory. A conspiracy that was never meant to be disturbed.*

Private investigator Maya Chen is running from her past, but her latest case is about to drag her back into the dark. Hired under mysterious circumstances to investigate the supposed suicide of a troubled young woman, Sarah Blackwood, Maya travels to the isolated Blackwood Island off the coast of Maine.

From the moment she arrives, the island feels unnervingly familiar, and the imposing Blackwood mansion seems to watch her with a chilling sense of recognition. The family is a knot of secrets: a controlling matriarch, a nervous heir, and a charismatic doctor whose charm conceals a horrifying agenda. They deny hiring her, but the approaching storm traps Maya on the island, forcing her to unravel a truth far more sinister than a simple suicide.

As fragmented memories of her own childhood begin to surface—memories of this very island, of Sarah, and of a terrible event buried for twenty-five years—Maya realizes she isn't just an investigator. She's a survivor. Hunted by a family with everything to lose, Maya must navigate a labyrinth of psychological manipulation and hidden passages to expose a conspiracy that has claimed more than one victim. But on Blackwood Island, some memories are deadly, and the truth won't set you free—it will get you killed.
