### Prompt 1: The Island's Gaze

**Concept:** Focuses on the gothic, atmospheric setting as the primary antagonist.
**Prompt:**
"Create a book cover for a psychological thriller titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik. The image should be a moody, atmospheric, and photorealistic book cover with a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The scene is a remote, rocky island off the coast of Maine, shrouded in a thick, swirling October mist. In the distance, perched atop the island's highest point, a dark, imposing Victorian mansion is partially visible through the fog, its windows like watching eyes. The color palette should be dominated by cool, desaturated blues, grays, and deep greens. The title, 'The Hollow Shore', should be in a sharp, elegant serif font, appearing subtly out of the mist. The author's name, Greg Ratajik, should be placed prominently. The overall mood is one of isolation, dread, and secrets held by the landscape itself."

### Prompt 2: The Investigator's Silhouette

**Concept:** Centers on the protagonist, Maya Chen, and her investigation.
**Prompt:**
"Design a book cover for a mystery novel titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik. The image, with a 1.6:1 aspect ratio, features the silhouette of a lone woman, an Asian-American private investigator, standing on a rocky shoreline looking towards a turbulent, gray sea. She is seen from behind, wearing a practical jacket. The sky is overcast and stormy. In the distance, barely visible through the fog, is the silhouette of a private island with a single, ominous house on its peak. The lighting is low and dramatic, creating a sense of foreboding. The title 'The Hollow Shore' should be in a clean, modern sans-serif font, placed starkly against the sky, with the author's name, Greg Ratajik, clearly visible. The style should feel like a blend of a classic detective novel and a modern psychological thriller."

### Prompt 3: The Forgotten Promise

**Concept:** A symbolic and minimalist approach focusing on a key object.
**Prompt:**
"Generate a minimalist and symbolic book cover for a literary thriller titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik. The image needs a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The central image is a small, intricately carved wooden bird resting on a piece of wet, dark driftwood. The background is out of focus, suggesting a misty, rocky beach. A single drop of water clings to the bird's wing, like a tear. The color palette is muted and somber, with earthy browns and grays. The lighting is soft and focused on the bird, creating a sense of a single, important clue in a vast, forgotten mystery. The title 'The Hollow Shore' should be in a delicate, slightly distressed serif font, and the author's name, Greg Ratajik, should be included. The overall mood is melancholic, mysterious, and deeply personal."

### Prompt 4: The Blue Room

**Concept:** An interior shot that hints at the psychological horror and suppressed memories.
**Prompt:**
"Create a book cover for a psychological horror novel titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik, formatted with a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The scene is a close-up of a section of faded, peeling wallpaper in a dark, forgotten room. The wallpaper has an intricate pattern of blue, spiraling vines and small flowers that almost look like eyes. The lighting is dim, coming from a single, off-camera source, casting long, eerie shadows. One part of the wallpaper is torn, revealing dark, rough wood underneath, hinting at hidden passages. The title 'The Hollow Shore' and author name 'Greg Ratajik' should appear as if they're part of the wallpaper pattern itself, almost hidden. The style is claustrophobic, unsettling, and hints at a history of trauma contained within the walls."

### Prompt 5: Fragmented Memories

**Concept:** A more abstract, modern thriller cover that visualizes the theme of memory.
**Prompt:**
"Design a modern and abstract book cover for a thriller titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik, with a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The image is a fractured, shattered photograph. The main visible piece is the eye of a young Asian-American woman (Maya), looking determined yet haunted. Other shards show glimpses of a stormy sea, the gables of a Victorian mansion, and the face of a blonde girl (Sarah). The fragments are arranged like broken glass against a dark, textured background. The title 'The Hollow Shore' and author name 'Greg Ratajik' are in a bold, sharp font, also appearing slightly fractured. The color scheme is dark with flashes of electric blue. The overall effect is one of a shattered past and a mind trying to piece together a terrible truth."

**Concept:** A literal interpretation of the book's central location, the caves.
**Prompt:**
"Generate a dark and suspenseful book cover for 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik, ensuring a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The scene is the entrance to a dark sea cave on a rocky, desolate coastline. The tide is low, revealing wet sand and seaweed-covered rocks. From the mouth of the cave, a faint, eerie blue light emanates, suggesting something unnatural within. The sky above is a bruised purple and gray of a coming storm. The title 'The Hollow Shore' is in a weathered, blocky font at the bottom, looking as if it's been carved into the rock, with the author's name 'Greg Ratajik' above or below it. The mood is one of ancient secrets, hidden horror, and the lure of a dangerous mystery."

### Prompt 7: The Orchid and the Lie

**Concept:** A sophisticated and symbolic cover hinting at the wider conspiracy and its architect.
**Prompt:**
"Create an elegant and menacing book cover for a conspiracy thriller titled 'The Hollow Shore' by Greg Ratajik, with a 1.6:1 aspect ratio. The central image is a single, perfect, impossibly rare orchid (a Vanda 'Rothschildiana' with deep purple and blue hues) against a stark, black background. The orchid is beautiful, but its stem is a sterile, metallic, medical-looking instrument that drips a single drop of a clear, viscous liquid. The lighting is clinical and sharp, like in a laboratory. The title 'The Hollow Shore' and author name 'Greg Ratajik' are in a clean, cold, and luxurious sans-serif font. The overall style is minimalist, sophisticated, and deeply unsettling, suggesting a beautiful facade hiding a monstrous, clinical evil."
