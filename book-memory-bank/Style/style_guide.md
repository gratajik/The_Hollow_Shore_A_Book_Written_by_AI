# Style Guide - "The Hollow Shore"

This document defines the writing style, language choices, and formatting conventions for your book. A consistent style enhances readability and professionalism while reducing reader distraction.

## Voice & Tone (Three-Author Blend)

**Narrative Voice**: Third-person limited with literary psychological depth blending:
- **Tana French influence**: Lyrical, introspective, atmospheric prose with poetic sensibility
- **Gillian Flynn influence**: Sharp, cynical observations with dark humor about family dysfunction
- **Kate Atkinson influence**: Dry wit, ironic observations, complex layered narratives

**Tone**: Predominantly atmospheric and psychologically unsettling, with mounting dread punctuated by moments of dark humor and ironic observation

**Emotional Range**: Full psychological spectrum - analytical detachment, growing unease, memory fragments surfacing, righteous anger, cathartic resolution, cautious hope

**Reader Relationship**: Immersive literary experience; no direct reader address; draws reader into Maya's psychological journey

## Point of View

**Primary POV**: Third-person limited, primarily Maya Chen's perspective

**POV Shifts**: 
- Occasional brief shifts to other characters for specific revelations (Eleanor, James, Dr. Richard)
- Childhood flashback sequences may shift to child-Maya's perspective
- Always clearly marked by section breaks or chapter transitions
- No head-hopping within scenes

**Interior Thoughts**: 
- Maya's analytical thoughts blended into narration through free indirect discourse
- Direct thought quotes in italics for emphasis or surprise moments
- Memory fragments presented in present tense for immediacy

**Knowledge Limitations**:
- Maya's POV limited to what she observes, remembers, or deduces
- Suppressed memories create unreliable knowledge that gradually improves
- Other character POVs used only for information Maya cannot access

## Language Choices

**Vocabulary Level**: 
- Literary but accessible - sophisticated without being pretentious
- Psychological and investigative terminology used naturally
- Medical/therapeutic terms often subverted to show manipulation
- Island and maritime imagery for metaphors and atmosphere

**Sentence Structure**: 
- **French style**: Longer, flowing sentences for atmospheric descriptions
- **Flynn style**: Short, sharp sentences for psychological observations and family dysfunction
- **Atkinson style**: Complex, layered sentences revealing multiple meanings
- Fragments during memory flashbacks or emotional intensity

**Paragraph Length**: 
- Generally medium length (4-6 sentences) for steady pacing
- Short paragraphs for emphasis, memory fragments, or tension
- Longer paragraphs for atmospheric scene-setting

**Dialect and Speech Patterns**: 
- Subtle Maine coastal accent in local characters (Captain Murphy, groundskeeper)
- Maya's Boston background occasionally influences word choice
- Professional terminology for investigative work
- Family members' speech patterns reveal personality and power dynamics

## Dialogue

**Dialogue Tags**: 
- Primarily "said" and "asked" with occasional descriptive verbs when they add meaning
- Action beats frequently used instead of tags
- Character-specific speaking verbs when appropriate (Eleanor "stated," James "stammered")

**Action Beats**: 
- Used to show emotional state and environmental details
- Often incorporate atmospheric elements (wind, waves, house sounds)
- Should reflect character psychology and growing tension

**Internal Dialogue**: 
- Italics for direct thought quotes
- Free indirect discourse blended into narration for most thoughts
- Stream of consciousness during memory recovery sequences

**Dialect and Accents**: 
- Minimal phonetic spelling - character voice through word choice and rhythm
- Eleanor's formal speech patterns vs. James's nervous rambling
- Dr. Richard's charming manipulation vs. clinical precision

## Grammar & Mechanics

**Tense**: 
- Past tense for main narrative

**Numbers**: 
- Numbers under one hundred spelled out in narrative prose
- Specific measurements, dates, and investigative details as numerals
- Money amounts as numerals ($50,000 commission)

## Formatting

**Chapter Headers**: 
- Chapter number and title centered (e.g., "Chapter 1: The Ferry to Blackwood Island")
- Extra line space before first paragraph

**Scene Breaks**: 
- Three centered asterisks (* * *) for significant time jumps

- Medical records and therapy notes in smaller indented blocks
- Phone conversations with clear speaker identification
- Newspaper clippings or official reports in distinct formatting

## Genre-Specific Conventions (Psychological Thriller)

**Setting Descriptions**:

## Problem Areas to Watch

**Crutch Words**: 
- "Suddenly" - replace with direct action or atmospheric buildup

- "Just" - usually unnecessary, cuts without replacement

**Genre Balance**:

- Keep literary prose moving at thriller pace
- Balance three author influences without losing coherent voice
- Don't let atmosphere overshadow plot progression

**Memory Plot Device**: 
- Ensure memory suppression feels realistic, not convenient
- Avoid "recovered memory syndrome" implications
- Ground triggers in specific sensory details
- Show gradual process, not sudden complete recall

**Family Dysfunction**: 
- Keep manipulation subtle and believable
- Show long-term patterns, not sudden revelations
- Balance individual pathology with systemic problems
- Avoid victimizing all characters equally

## Stylistic Integration Notes

**Balancing Three Authors**:
- French's lyricism for setting and introspection
- Flynn's sharpness for family dynamics and dark humor  
- Atkinson's complexity for plot structure and ironic observation
- Unified through Maya's consistent voice and perspective

**Pacing Considerations**:
- Slow atmospheric build (French) with psychological tension (Flynn)
- Complex reveals (Atkinson) without losing thriller momentum
- Memory fragments as both character development and plot advancement
- Investigation structure providing forward motion through literary exploration

**Tonal Consistency**:
- Dark psychological thriller with hope for healing
- Beautiful prose serving psychological horror rather than overwhelming it
- Humor emerging from character observation, not undercutting emotional weight
- Resolution satisfying both justice needs and psychological realism

ALWAYS write like a human author would, unless specially told something different for a character:

- Loosen the formality while maintaining literary quality
- Use contractions, broken sentences, and natural rhythm in dialogue
- Let characters interrupt, pause, react authentically to psychological pressure
- Add emotional color and subtext reflecting suppressed family dynamics
- Emphasize personal psychological experience over clinical explanations
- Focus on small human cues revealing hidden emotional states
- Use atmospheric metaphors and psychological parallels effectively
- Insert grounded comparisons that illuminate character psychology
- Let dialogue reflect personality, power dynamics, and hidden agendas
