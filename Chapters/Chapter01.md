# Chapter 1: The Ferry to Blackwood Island

The ferry's engine thrummed beneath Maya Chen's feet, a steady pulse that should have been soothing but instead set her teeth on edge. She stood at the rail, watching Blackwood Island emerge from the October mist like something half-remembered from a dream. The sight of it—dark pines crowding down to granite shores, the suggestion of a roofline through the trees—stirred something in her chest that felt dangerously close to recognition.

*Impossible*, she told herself, checking her phone for the dozenth time since leaving the mainland. No signal. Of course. She'd never been this far up the Maine coast, had never set foot on any of these private islands that dotted the waters like scattered secrets. Her life had been Boston and Columbia before that, with nothing in between but the careful, methodical building of a career that had collapsed five years ago with one wrong identification.

Maya tapped her right index finger against the case file balanced on the ferry's salt-stained rail. The commission letter crinkled under her touch, its elegant script promising fifty thousand dollars for what should have been a straightforward investigation. *Should have been*. In her experience, nothing that paid this well was ever straightforward.

"Hell of a day to be heading out to Blackwood."

The ferry captain had materialized beside her, his weathered face turned toward the island with an expression Maya couldn't quite read. Captain Murphy, according to the faded nameplate on his jacket. She'd tried to engage him in conversation when she'd first boarded, but he'd been taciturn then, focused on navigating the channel. Now, with the island looming larger, he seemed inclined to talk.

"Why's that?" Maya kept her voice professionally neutral, though something in his tone had sharpened her attention.

"Storm coming in tonight. Maybe tomorrow. You can smell it." He inhaled deeply, as if to demonstrate. "Course, might be fitting. The Blackwoods, they've always had a taste for drama."

"You know the family well?"

Murphy's laugh was more bark than humor. "Know them? Been ferrying folks to that island for thirty years. Knew the old man before his heart gave out, know Eleanor now. Knew that poor girl Sarah since she was knee-high to a grasshopper." His expression darkened. "Damn shame what happened."

Maya had read the police report three times on the drive up from Boston. Sarah Blackwood, thirty-three, found floating in the tidal pool on the island's eastern shore. Apparent suicide by drowning. Case closed, according to local law enforcement. But the woman claiming to be Eleanor Blackwood who'd called Maya three days ago had been certain—*certain*—that her granddaughter had been murdered.

"Were you surprised?" Maya asked carefully. "When you heard about Sarah?"

Murphy was quiet for a long moment, watching the island grow larger. When he spoke, his Maine accent thickened. "Some places, they hold onto things. Memories, maybe. Ghosts, if you're inclined to believe such foolishness. That island..." He shook his head. "Let's just say I wasn't surprised to hear something tragic had happened there again."

*Again*. Maya filed that away, her finger tapping faster against the folder. "There've been other tragedies?"

But Murphy was already moving away, muttering something about preparing to dock. Maya watched him go, then turned back to the island. The mist was lifting now, revealing more details—a wooden dock stretching into the dark water, a boathouse that had seen better days, and beyond that, a winding path disappearing into the pines. At the island's highest point, she could just make out the peaked roofs and elaborate gables of what had to be the Blackwood house.

Something twisted in her stomach, a sensation she couldn't name. The house seemed to watch her approach, its windows catching the late afternoon light like eyes. She'd seen plenty of old mansions in her work, had investigated crimes in buildings far more imposing than this Victorian relic. But something about this place...

*Lord have mercy*, she thought, then caught herself. The South had been creeping back into her internal voice lately, despite fifteen years in Boston. Stress did that—made her feel like that uncertain girl from Columbia who'd thought a psychology degree and a badge could fix the world. Before Marcus Williams. Before she'd learned that being wrong could cost lives.

The ferry's engine changed pitch, and Maya automatically braced herself as they approached the dock. She gathered her things—overnight bag, laptop case, the file folder that had brought her here—and tried to shake off the strange mood. She had a job to do. A family had hired her to find the truth about their daughter's death. The fact that they were paying enough to cover three months of her struggling agency's expenses was irrelevant to the work itself.

Or it should have been.

A figure was waiting on the dock as the ferry bumped against the pilings. Middle-aged, slight build, nervous energy radiating from him like heat shimmer. This would be James Blackwood, Sarah's father. Maya had done her research—investment banker, never married, raised his daughter alone after her mother's death in childbirth. The photographs she'd found online showed a confident professional in expensive suits. The man waiting for her looked like he hadn't slept in days.

"Ms. Chen?" He stepped forward as she disembarked, extending a hand that trembled slightly. "I'm James Blackwood. I—we weren't expecting anyone today."

Maya's hand paused halfway to his. "I'm sorry?"

"The police said they were done. Detective Park assured us..." He trailed off, confusion clouding his features. "Are you with the state police? I thought the case was closed."

The twist in Maya's stomach tightened. She pulled out the commission letter, keeping her voice steady despite the alarm bells starting to chime in her head. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm a private investigator. Your mother hired me three days ago to look into your daughter's death."

James took the letter, his frown deepening as he read. Behind him, Maya heard Captain Murphy securing the ferry, preparing for the return trip to the mainland. She had a sudden, irrational urge to get back on board.

"This is..." James looked up, his face pale. "This looks like Mother's stationery, but she didn't... I mean, we discussed hiring someone, but she decided against it. Said we needed to accept what happened, that Sarah had been troubled for years."

"Mr. Blackwood—"

"We should go up to the house." He handed the letter back, his movements sharp with agitation. "Mother will want to see this. She'll want to explain."

They started up the path from the dock, James setting a quick pace despite the uneven ground. Maya followed, her investigator's instincts cataloging details even as her mind raced. The path was well-maintained but old, worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. Through the trees, she caught glimpses of structures—a gazebo overwhelmed by climbing roses, what might have been a child's playhouse now collapsed with age.

"Your family has owned the island for a long time," she observed, partly to fill the uncomfortable silence, partly to gauge his response.

"Three generations." James didn't slow his pace. "My great-grandfather bought it in the twenties. We used to summer here when I was young, the whole family. Sarah loved it here when she was little. Before..."

He didn't finish, and Maya didn't push. She'd learned long ago that silence often yielded more than questions.

The path curved, and suddenly the trees opened up to reveal the house in all its Gothic glory. Three stories of weathered shingles and elaborate trim work, towers and turrets reaching toward the gray sky like grasping fingers. A wraparound porch sagged slightly on one side, and several windows on the upper floors were boarded over. Beautiful and desolate, like something out of a Hawthorne story.

Maya's step faltered. For just a moment, she could have sworn she'd seen this exact view before—the way the path emerged from the trees, the angle of the house against the sky, even the pattern of shadows on the porch. But that was impossible. She'd never been to Maine before this case, had never...

"Ms. Chen? Are you all right?"

James had stopped, was looking at her with concern. Maya forced herself to move forward. "Yes, sorry. It's just... it's a beautiful house."

"It was." His voice held old grief. "It's been letting go for years now. Sarah used to say houses were like people—they could die of broken hearts."

They climbed the porch steps, and James opened the massive front door without knocking. "Mother? We have a visitor."

The entrance hall was all dark wood and faded grandeur, dominated by a staircase that curved up into shadow. Portraits lined the walls—generations of Blackwoods staring down with the fixed expressions of the long dead. The air smelled of lemon polish and something else, something Maya couldn't quite identify. Old flowers, maybe. Or the sea.

"James? Who on earth—"

Eleanor Blackwood appeared at the top of the stairs, and even from a distance, Maya could feel the force of her presence. Seventy years old but carrying herself like royalty, silver hair swept up in an elegant chignon, wearing a black dress that probably cost more than Maya's car. She descended slowly, her gaze fixed on Maya with an intensity that made that twist in her stomach tighten another notch.

"Mother, this is Maya Chen. She says you hired her to investigate Sarah's death."

Eleanor reached the bottom of the stairs and studied Maya for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was cultured, controlled, and absolutely certain.

"I did no such thing."

Maya held out the commission letter. "Mrs. Blackwood, we spoke on the phone three days ago. You sent this letter, along with a retainer check for twenty-five thousand dollars."

Eleanor took the letter, examining it with the same intensity she'd focused on Maya. The silence stretched, broken only by the sound of wind rattling the windows. Finally, she looked up.

"This is my stationery. That appears to be my signature." She paused, and Maya saw something flicker in her eyes—fear? Confusion? "But I did not write this letter, Ms. Chen. And I certainly didn't hire you."

The words hung in the air like a challenge. Or a warning. Outside, the wind picked up, and Maya heard Captain Murphy's ferry horn—three long blasts, the signal for last call. If she left now, she could catch it. Go back to Boston, return the money, forget this strange island and its stranger atmosphere.

Instead, she heard herself say, "Then I think we need to figure out who did."

Eleanor's smile was sharp as winter. "Indeed. It seems someone has gone to considerable trouble to bring you here. The question is why."

Thunder rumbled in the distance, and Maya knew with sudden certainty that she wouldn't be leaving Blackwood Island tonight. Whatever game someone was playing, she was already on the board.

And despite every instinct screaming at her to run, she needed to know why this place felt like a half-remembered nightmare finally coming into focus.
