# Chapter 3: First Night Revelations

Maya sat on the edge of the narrow bed, staring at the blue wallpaper that seemed to pulse in the lamplight. The pattern wasn't random, she realized now. Delicate vines twisted in spirals, punctuated by small flowers that looked almost like eyes watching her. Her finger traced one of the spirals, and suddenly she could see another hand—smaller, younger—following the same path.

*A child's voice, her own voice, whispering: "Look, Sarah, it's like a secret code."*

She jerked her hand back, heart hammering. The memory fragment had been so clear, so immediate, that for a moment she'd felt eight years old again. She pulled out the pages she'd taken from Sarah's room, spreading them across the faded blue bedspread.

*Maya knows. She was there. We promised never to tell, but what if we were wrong? What if silence is what he wants?*

*Dr. Torres says recovered memories can feel more real than regular memories. The body remembers even when the mind forgets. Why do I keep dreaming about the blue room?*

Maya's hands were shaking as she read Sarah's increasingly frantic handwriting. The blue room. She was in the blue room now, and Sarah had been dreaming about it. Had been remembering it.

A soft knock at the door made her quickly fold the papers and slip them under her pillow.

"Ms. Chen?" Margaret Swift's voice was muffled through the wood. "Dinner's ready. Such as it is, with the power acting up."

"Thank you. I'll be right down."

Maya checked her reflection in the small mirror above the dresser. She looked pale, shaken, but she forced her expression into professional neutrality. Whatever was happening here, whatever she'd been part of as a child, she needed to stay focused. Stay alive.

The dining room was a study in Gothic grandeur, all dark wood and heavy silver that gleamed in the candlelight. The power had flickered on and off throughout the evening, and now they were dining by candles and oil lamps, the storm having finally overwhelmed the old electrical system. The effect was both beautiful and ominous, shadows dancing across the family portraits that lined the walls.

Eleanor sat at the head of the table like a queen holding court, her silver hair perfectly arranged despite the chaos of the storm. James fidgeted in his chair, his nervous energy crackling like electricity. And Dr. Richard... Dr. Richard watched Maya with those sharp gray eyes, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

"I hope you're feeling better," he said as Maya took her seat. "You looked quite distressed earlier. Sometimes old houses can be overwhelming, especially during storms."

"I'm fine, thank you." Maya kept her voice level, professional. "Just tired from the journey."

"Of course." He cut into his cold roast beef with surgical precision. "Tell me, Maya—may I call you Maya?—have you ever experienced false memories? Sometimes stress can create very convincing recollections of events that never happened."

The question was casual, conversational, but Maya felt the trap in it. "I'm not sure what you mean."

"Oh, it's quite common. The mind is remarkably creative when it comes to filling in gaps. A person might remember being somewhere they've never been, or meeting someone they've never met. Particularly if they're under psychological pressure."

Eleanor dabbed at her lips with a linen napkin. "Richard has extensive experience with memory disorders. He's helped many people sort through... confused recollections."

"Sarah, for instance," Dr. Richard continued, his voice taking on a clinical tone. "In her final weeks, she became convinced she remembered things from her childhood that simply couldn't have happened. She was too young, you see. The mind sometimes creates false memories to explain feelings of unease or trauma."

James's fork clattered against his plate. "She wasn't making it up. Sarah was scared. She kept saying she remembered the accident, but Mother said it was impossible because she was too young, but I remember—"

"James." Eleanor's voice was sharp as a blade. "We've discussed this."

"But she was trying to tell me something important, and I didn't listen, and now she's—"

"James." Dr. Richard's voice was gentler but somehow more threatening. "You know how these conversations upset you. Perhaps you should take your medication."

"I don't want my medication. I want to know what happened to my daughter."

The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken threats. Maya watched the family dynamics play out, noting how quickly James had been silenced, how Eleanor and Dr. Richard worked in tandem to control the conversation.

"What accident?" Maya asked quietly.

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

"A childhood incident," Eleanor said carefully. "Years ago. Nothing that concerns you."

"If it's connected to Sarah's state of mind before her death, it concerns me very much."

Dr. Richard leaned back in his chair, studying Maya with renewed interest. "You're very thorough, aren't you? Very... persistent. Tell me, what brought you from psychology to private investigation? You did study psychology, didn't you?"

Maya went very still. She hadn't mentioned her educational background to him. "How did you know that?"

"Just a guess. You have the observational skills, the way of asking questions. It's quite distinctive." His smile was disarming, but his eyes remained cold. "I'm curious about your background, your training. Your mental health history."

"My mental health history?"

"Well, this is a stressful situation. You're isolated, investigating a death, staying in an unfamiliar place. Sometimes people with certain... vulnerabilities... can experience episodes under such circumstances."

Maya felt her Southern drawl threatening to emerge and fought to keep it down. "I appreciate your concern, Dr. Blackwood, but I'm perfectly fine."

"Of course you are. But if you need anything—something to help you sleep, perhaps—I always travel with my medical bag. I have some very effective sedatives."

The lights flickered and went out completely, plunging them into the dancing shadows of candlelight. In the darkness, Maya heard James whisper, "Just like the night Sarah died. The power went out then too."

When the emergency lighting kicked in a few seconds later, Dr. Richard was standing much closer to Maya's chair than he had been before.

"I should check the generator," Margaret said from the doorway. "Might be running low on fuel."

"Yes, do that," Eleanor said. "And perhaps we should all retire early. It's been a long day."

Maya excused herself, claiming exhaustion, but instead of going to her room, she waited in the hallway until she heard the family members dispersing. Then, moving as quietly as she could, she made her way back to Sarah's room.

The door was unlocked, and Maya slipped inside, using her phone's flashlight to navigate. She'd been thorough earlier, but the power outage had given her an idea. Old houses like this often had hidden spaces, servant passages, places where secrets could be kept.

She ran her hands along the baseboards, looking for loose boards or hidden latches. Behind Sarah's dresser, she found what she was looking for—a section of baseboard that moved when she pressed it. Behind it was a small compartment, and inside that compartment was a manila envelope.

Maya's hands trembled as she opened it. Inside were photographs, old ones from the look of the paper and the faded colors. Children playing on a beach, children in the mansion's garden, children gathered around a birthday cake.

And there, in photo after photo, were two little girls who looked exactly like Maya and Sarah.

Maya sank to the floor, staring at the evidence of her childhood presence on this island. In one photo, she and Sarah were building a sandcastle, both of them laughing. In another, they were dressed up for what looked like a formal dinner, standing with a group of other children. But it was the last photo that made Maya's blood run cold.

It showed a group of children, but one of them—a little boy with dark hair—looked terrified. His eyes were wide with fear, and he seemed to be trying to hide behind the other children. Maya recognized the look. She'd seen it in crime scene photos, in interviews with traumatized witnesses.

That child had been afraid for his life.

Maya photographed each picture with her phone, then carefully replaced them in the envelope. But as she was putting the baseboard back in place, she felt a draft. Cold air was coming from somewhere behind the wall.

Following the draft, she discovered that Sarah's room had access to the mansion's hidden passages—servant stairs that led down to the basement. Maya hesitated for only a moment before following them down.

The basement was a maze of storage rooms and mechanical spaces, but one room in particular caught her attention. It was filled with filing cabinets, and when Maya opened the first drawer, she found medical records going back decades.

File after file of children who had visited the island. Treatment records. Therapy notes. And there, in a file marked "Chen, Maya - Age 8," was her own medical history.

*Patient exhibits severe anxiety following traumatic incident. Recommend immediate memory suppression therapy to prevent long-term psychological damage. Treatment successful - patient shows no recollection of events. Recommend no further contact with Blackwood family to maintain therapeutic gains.*

Maya's hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the file. Memory suppression therapy. Someone had deliberately erased her memories of this place, of whatever had happened here.

She photographed page after page, her phone's camera flash illuminating the dusty basement like lightning. There were files on dozens of children, all with similar notes about "incidents" and "therapeutic interventions." All signed by Dr. Richard Blackwood.

Footsteps echoed from somewhere above. Someone was looking for her.

Maya quickly closed the files and made her way back through the hidden passages to Sarah's room. She'd just managed to slip out into the hallway when she heard Dr. Richard's voice from the direction of her room.

"Maya? Are you all right? I thought I heard something."

She forced herself to walk calmly toward him. "I was just getting some water from the bathroom. The storm is keeping me awake."

He studied her face in the dim emergency lighting. "You look pale. Are you sure you're feeling well?"

"Just tired."

"Hmm." He stepped closer, and Maya caught the scent of antiseptic and something else—something medicinal. "You know, I've been thinking about our conversation at dinner. About false memories and psychological stress. I'm concerned that this investigation might be triggering some kind of episode for you."

"I'm fine, Dr. Blackwood."

"Are you? Because I have to say, you seem... agitated. Confused. Sometimes people think they remember things that never happened, especially when they're in a place that feels familiar for reasons they can't quite identify."

Maya's heart was pounding, but she kept her voice steady. "What are you suggesting?"

"I'm suggesting that perhaps you should let me help you. I have something that could help you sleep, help you think more clearly. Sometimes the mind needs... guidance... to process difficult situations properly."

"That's very kind, but I don't need any medication."

"Of course not. But the offer stands." He stepped back, but his eyes never left her face. "Sleep well, Maya. Tomorrow we'll talk about your memories. Sometimes the mind needs help distinguishing between what's real and what's... constructed."

He turned and walked away, leaving Maya alone in the hallway. She waited until she heard his door close, then hurried to her own room, locking the door behind her.

Maya sat on the bed, her mind racing. The photos, the medical files, her own suppressed memories—it was all connected. She'd been here as a child, she'd been friends with Sarah, and something terrible had happened. Something that Dr. Richard had covered up by erasing her memories.

But the memories were coming back now, triggered by the house, by the blue room, by the stress of the investigation. And Dr. Richard knew it. That's why he was talking about sedatives, about helping her "process" her memories. He wanted to suppress them again.

Maya lay down on the bed, still fully clothed, and closed her eyes. But sleep, when it finally came, brought with it dreams that felt more real than reality.

*She was eight years old, hiding in the basement with Sarah. They could hear shouting from upstairs, adult voices raised in anger and fear.*

*"It was an accident!" someone was saying. "No one meant for this to happen!"*

*"We have to call the police," another voice said. "We have to—"*

*"We can't. Think about what this would do to the family. To all our families."*

*Footsteps on the basement stairs. Dr. Richard's voice, calm and controlled: "Girls, come out. Everything's going to be all right."*

*But Maya had seen him carrying something wrapped in a sheet. Something small and still. And she'd seen the blood on his hands.*

*"Maya," Sarah whispered, her young voice high with terror. "We have to promise never to tell. Promise me."*

*"I promise," eight-year-old Maya whispered back. "I promise I'll never tell."*

Maya woke with a gasp, her heart hammering against her ribs. The dream had been so vivid, so real, that she could still smell the musty basement air, still feel Sarah's small hand gripping hers.

But it hadn't been a dream. It had been a memory.

She'd witnessed a cover-up as a child. She'd seen Dr. Richard dispose of evidence, heard the family decide to hide whatever had happened. And then they'd made sure she couldn't remember by erasing her memories entirely.

Maya sat up in bed, her mind crystal clear for the first time since arriving on the island. She wasn't here to investigate Sarah's death. She was here because someone wanted her to remember what had happened all those years ago. Someone wanted the truth to finally come out.

But Dr. Richard knew she was remembering. And tomorrow, he was going to try to stop her.

Maya checked her phone. No signal, of course. The storm had knocked out the cell towers. She was truly alone with a family that had covered up one death and wouldn't hesitate to cover up another.

Outside her window, the storm raged on, and somewhere in the house, she could hear footsteps pacing back and forth, back and forth, like someone who couldn't sleep.

Like someone who was planning what to do about a problem that was getting out of hand.

Maya pulled the covers up to her chin and tried to stay awake, but exhaustion finally claimed her. Her last conscious thought was a fragment of memory: Sarah's young voice, terrified and desperate.

*"Promise me, Maya. Promise you'll never tell."*

But some promises, Maya realized as sleep took her, were meant to be broken.
