# Chapter 16: The Dominoes Fall

The day after the interrogation, Maya felt like she was living in two separate worlds. In one, she was the triumphant lead consultant in a global investigation, the lynchpin who had broken the case wide open. In the other, she was a daughter adrift, haunted by the ghost of a man in a prison cell who knew more about her own family than she did.

Agent Martinez slid a transcript across his desk. "He lost, Maya. He gave us the whole damn network on a platter. 'Project Nightingale.' 'The Collectors' Circle.' He couldn't resist showing off how clever he was. Don't let him win a consolation prize by getting in your head."

"I know what he was doing," Maya said, her voice flat as she stared at Richard's printed words. "But the most effective lies are always wrapped around a kernel of truth. I just need to find out which part is which."

"We'll get there," Martinez promised. "For now, let's focus on the win. The name 'Alistair' was all Interpol needed."

He turned her toward the main operations room. It was a symphony of controlled chaos. On a bank of large screens, a montage of the world's ugliest news was playing out. A tactical team in Bucharest, their faces grim, raiding a lavish villa. An elderly, cultured man named Alistair, protesting his innocence as they led him away from a room filled with what looked like abstract digital art. News anchors in Brazil and Thailand speaking in urgent tones about the arrests of prominent businessmen. The dominoes were falling, fast and hard, all across the globe.

Agent Kim, looking wired and triumphant, pointed to a screen showing Alistair's "gallery." "They weren't just pictures," he explained. "They were complex neuro-simulations, running on custom hardware. The 'preserved consciousnesses' Richard was selling. Alistair was his first and best customer."

Maya felt a chill crawl up her spine. This wasn't just a pedophile ring. It was a marketplace for souls.

The professional victory felt vast and impersonal. The personal wound, however, was intimate and sharp. That evening, she sat in her quiet hotel room, the city lights of Portland twinkling below, and dialed her therapist.

"I feel like I'm standing on an island," she told Dr. Chen, the words tumbling out of her, raw and unedited, "and the ground on every side just crumbled into the sea. My abuser, my parents... there's no safe harbor."

Dr. Chen's voice was a calm anchor in the storm of Maya's thoughts. "Or maybe," she suggested gently, "you've just discovered you were never on an island at all. You were standing on the wreckage of other people's choices. Now you can finally see the whole picture and decide where to build your own solid ground."

Maya was quiet for a long moment, letting the words sink in. "He said my past was a weakness. He tried to use it against me."

"Did he succeed?" Dr. Chen asked.

"No," Maya admitted. "I used it against him. My memories... they were the key."

"Then it's not a weakness, is it?" Dr. Chen said. "It's the source of your insight. It's the reason you can see the patterns no one else can. It's a painful, terrible gift, Maya. But it's yours. It's your superpower."

A superpower. The idea was so absurd it almost made her laugh. But as she ended the call, she felt a subtle shift inside her. The pain was still there, a deep, resonant ache. But it was no longer just a wound. It was a lens. A tool. A weapon.

She returned to the FBI office the next morning feeling... different. More centered. The two worlds she was inhabiting hadn't merged, but she felt more capable of navigating both. She found Martinez and Kim huddled over a laptop, their faces alight with the thrill of the hunt.

"You're gonna want to see this," Kim said, his fingers flying across the keyboard. "I cracked the primary encryption on Richard's financial ledger."

On the screen, a meticulous record of evil scrolled by. Transactions for "acquisitions" and "patronage fees." Coded line items that corresponded to the names of the children. Payments to shell corporations that funded the cave operations, the mainland safe house, the private jet.

"It's a masterpiece of criminal accounting," Kim said with grudging admiration. "But the money trail is undeniable. And look at this."

He highlighted a recurring, substantial payment, larger than all the others, from a shell corporation named "The Nightingale Fund."

"Project Nightingale," Maya breathed.

"Exactly," Martinez said. "The fund is bankrolled by the Blackwood Foundation, but the payments aren't authorized by Richard or Eleanor. They're authorized by an external signatory."

Kim pointed to a black, redacted box on the screen. "The name is protected by a secondary layer of encryption. It's military-grade. It's going to take time to crack. But whoever this is, they weren't just a patron. They were a partner. Maybe even the one in charge."

Maya stared at the redacted name, a new, cold certainty forming in her gut. The true client. The one who had hired her, knowing she was the only one who could unravel this. The one who had set all these dominoes up, waiting for the right person to push.

"Let's find out who," she said, her voice a quiet promise. The hunt wasn't over. It had just moved to a higher, more dangerous level.
