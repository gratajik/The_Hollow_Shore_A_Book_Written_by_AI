# Chapter 20: The Summer of Ghosts

**Blackwood Island - 25 Years Ago**

The island, to an eight-year-old Maya Chen, was magic. It smelled of salt and pine and the damp, secret smell of moss in the deep woods. She arrived on a ferry that cut through a silver fog, holding her mother's hand, her father beside them looking important with his leather briefcase. They were here for the whole summer, her parents hired as "therapeutic consultants" for the Blackwood Foundation's special summer program for gifted children.

Maya wasn't gifted. She was just... there.

She met Sarah Blackwood on the first day. Sarah was small and quiet, with blonde hair that seemed to float around her head like a halo. She had wide, serious eyes that saw everything. They became friends with the fierce, instant loyalty of lonely children. "They're always watching us," Sarah whispered to Maya on the second day, gesturing to the adults. "Taking notes."

It was true. The adults—her parents, the Blackwoods, and especially Sarah's uncle, the charming Dr. Richard—were always observing, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes.

Their world was the other children in the program. There were fifteen of them, all ages, all "special" in some way. Their leader, by unspoken agreement, was Tommy Morrison. He was ten, two years older than Maya and Sarah, and he was fearless. He had a gap-toothed grin and a charisma that drew the other children to him like moths to a flame. "Come on," he'd yell, "I found a new cave down by the shore!" and they would all follow.

And then there was Ethan. He was twelve, the oldest of the children, and he was a ghost long before the summer was over. He was quiet, watchful, and moved with a stillness that was unnerving. He was another "special case," the adults said, one who needed "quiet observation." He saw more than any of them. He saw the truth.

Their secret kingdom was the network of smuggler's caves that riddled the island's coastline. They called it "the hollow shore." It was their sanctuary, a place away from the watchful eyes of the adults. Tommy was the adventurer, pushing deeper into the darkness. Sarah was the artist, her chalk drawings of mermaids and sea monsters covering the cave walls. Maya was the strategist, meticulously mapping their explorations in a small notebook. And Ethan was the scout, the silent observer who noticed everything.

He was the first to notice the changes. "They're putting lights in the deep caves," he told Tommy one afternoon, his voice a low whisper. "And equipment. Medical stuff."

They started noticing other things, too. Children would be taken for "special sessions" with Dr. Richard and come back... different. Quieter. Their eyes holding the same vacant look Maya had seen in the children they'd rescued from the caves a lifetime later.

"He's drugging us," Ethan said to Tommy, his face grim. They were huddled in their favorite chamber, the one Sarah called the "Cathedral" because of the high, vaulted ceiling. "In the juice at dinner. Small doses. To make us... suggestible."

Tommy's adventurous grin was gone, replaced by a hard, determined line. "This isn't right," he said. "What he's doing to us. We have to get out of here."

"They watch the main dock," Ethan said. "But they don't watch the old cove. There's a boat. I've seen it."

The game was over. The adventure had become a desperate plan for escape.

They made their move on a moonless night. Eleven of them, a small tribe of frightened children, led by their ten-year-old king and his silent, twelve-year-old advisor. Maya and Sarah held hands in the middle of the pack, their hearts pounding a frantic rhythm against their ribs.

They moved through the familiar darkness of the hollow shore, the sound of the waves a distant, promising roar. They were so close. The salty air of the hidden cove was on their faces.

Then the lights flashed on, bright and blinding.

Dr. Richard stood at the mouth of the cave, his tall frame a terrifying silhouette. Beside him, Eleanor Blackwood watched, her face a mask of cold disappointment.

"Going somewhere, children?" Dr. Richard asked, his voice dangerously soft.

Tommy, brave, foolish, wonderful Tommy, pushed Maya and Sarah behind him. "You can't keep us here!" he yelled, his voice cracking but defiant. "We're leaving!"

In that split second of confrontation, Ethan moved. He grabbed Maya's hand and pressed a small, smooth object into her palm. It was a bird, carved from driftwood. "Remember," he whispered, his voice urgent. Then he was gone, melting into a side tunnel, a ghost disappearing back into the shadows, unseen by the furious adults.

"Run!" Tommy screamed, a desperate, selfless command.

Dr. Richard's charming facade finally crumbled, revealing the monster beneath. He moved with a speed that was shocking, pulling a small, silver handgun from his coat.

The gunshot was not loud. It was a flat, ugly pop that seemed to suck all the air out of the cave. Tommy Morrison fell, a small, crumpled heap on the sandy floor. A dark stain began to spread around him.

The world stopped. The children stood frozen, a silent, horrified chorus.

The aftermath was cold and clinical. The children were herded back to the "classroom," the modified chamber with the medical equipment. Dr. Richard was calm again, his voice smooth and reassuring as he stood before them.

"This is what happens to children who don't follow the rules," he said, his eyes sweeping over their terrified faces. "But it's alright. You will all forget this. This was a bad dream."

Maya looked for her parents. She saw them standing at the back of the chamber, their faces pale, their eyes wide with a horror they did nothing to stop. Her mother looked at her, then quickly looked away. It was a betrayal so profound it stole the breath from her lungs.

A woman in a nurse's uniform came toward her with a syringe. Maya's small hand tightened around the wooden bird in her pocket, the sharp edges digging into her palm. She looked at Sarah, who was crying silently. She looked at Tommy's empty space in their circle.

Then came the prick of the needle. The world began to swim, the edges of her vision going soft and fuzzy. The last thing she heard was the distant, rhythmic crash of the waves on the hollow shore, a sound that would haunt her dreams for the next twenty-five years. The memory of the gunshot, of Tommy's fall, of her parents' averted eyes, was already beginning to feel like a dream she was trying, and failing, to hold onto.
