# Chapter 23: The Echo of a Ghost

Nova Scotia in late autumn felt like the edge of the world. The wind that swept in off the North Atlantic had a raw, scouring quality, as if it were trying to strip the land down to its granite bones. It was a place that kept its secrets locked tight.

Maya stood on a bluff overlooking a churning, slate-gray sea, the FBI-chartered SUV parked a respectful distance behind her. Agent Martinez was inside, finalizing their operational details with a stern-faced officer from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The air here was different from Blackwood Island—cleaner, colder, without the cloying scent of decay that had clung to the Blackwood estate. But the ocean was the same. It was the same vast, indifferent witness.

Their first stop had been the community youth center in the tiny fishing village of Peggy’s Cove. The building was a testament to maritime resilience, hunkered down against the wind, its paint peeling in long, salty strips. The director, a woman with kind eyes and a healthy skepticism of American federal agents, remembered the donation from fifteen years ago. “Felt like a miracle at the time,” she’d said, her Canadian accent rounding the edges of her words. “Kept the lights on for a whole winter. But it was just a wire transfer. Anonymous. We never knew who to thank.”

It was a dead end, just as Kim had predicted. A confirmed link, but no human face to attach to it.

“He wouldn’t have stayed here,” Martinez said, coming to stand beside Maya. “Not for long. A place this small, a new face would be noticed.”

“He needed to be invisible,” Maya agreed. “But he needed to learn. He needed a trade. Something quiet. Something with his hands.” She thought of the bird, the impossible detail in its tiny, carved feathers. “He needed to learn how to make things that could hold a memory.”

That was the thread that led them to Silas. The RCMP liaison, a man named Corporal Dubois, had done his homework. The Renault Artisan Collective was long gone, scattered by time and tide, but one of its founding members was still alive. “Silas Blackwood,” Dubois had said, with a wry twist of his lips. “No relation to your people, I hope. He’s a bit of a hermit. Lives up the coast. Doesn’t much care for visitors.”

Silas’s cabin was tucked into a cove, accessible only by a winding dirt track. It looked as if it had grown out of the rock, its driftwood walls and seaweed-thatched roof a part of the landscape itself. Smoke curled from a stone chimney, the only sign of life.

He met them on his porch, a gnarled, white-bearded man with eyes the color of the sea in a storm. He held a half-finished carving of a seal in one hand and a wicked-looking knife in the other. He looked at the official vehicles, at the agents in their dark, practical jackets, and his face closed down like a fist.

“We’re not buying anything,” he grunted, his voice a low rumble like stones rolling in the surf.

Martinez stepped forward, professional and direct. “Mr. Blackwood, we’re with the FBI. We’d like to ask you a few questions about a young man who may have worked with your collective in the late nineties.”

Silas spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dirt. “Don’t know anyone who’d want to talk to the FBI.”

Maya saw the wall go up, thick and impenetrable. She held up a hand to Martinez, a silent request. She walked forward slowly, alone, stopping at the bottom step of the porch. She didn’t introduce herself as a consultant or an agent. She just looked at him, one survivor to another.

“We’re not here to cause trouble, sir,” she said, her voice quiet, letting her Southern accent soften the words. “I’m looking for a friend. A boy who was lost a long, long time ago.”

She opened her hand and showed him the small wooden bird.

Silas’s stormy eyes fixed on it. He squinted, his head tilting. He put down his seal carving and reached out a calloused, trembling hand. He didn’t take the bird, but his finger traced its wing. “Well, I’ll be,” he breathed. “The boy’s work. Haven’t seen one of these in twenty years.”

He looked at Maya then, truly looked at her, and the suspicion in his eyes was replaced by a deep, ancient sadness. “You’d best come inside,” he said.

The cabin was one room, smelling of woodsmoke, salt, and turpentine. Silas settled into a rocking chair by the fire and began to talk. The boy, he said, had called himself Leo. He’d shown up one summer, a quiet, haunted-looking teenager, looking for work. He was a natural carver, his hands steady and precise, his focus absolute. “It was like he was carving his own ghosts out of the wood,” Silas said, his voice distant. “Putting the hurt into something beautiful so he could look at it. I understood that.”

“Leo” had stayed for two years, saving every penny he made. He learned the trade, mastered the tools, and then, as quietly as he’d arrived, he’d left. “Said he had a promise to keep,” Silas recalled, his eyes on the fire. “Never said what it was. Never said where he was going.”

Maya felt a thrill run through her, the thrill of a trail growing warm. “Was there anything else? Anything he was interested in?”

Silas nodded slowly. “Funny thing. For a boy who worked with his hands, his head was always in machines. Always sketching. Not just birds and beasts, but… schematics. Wires and circuits. Said he wanted to understand how things were put together. How they could be taken apart.” He paused, thinking. “Had a post office box in the village. Used to get these technical magazines. Journals about electronics. Security systems.”

Martinez, who had been listening from the doorway, gave a sharp, almost imperceptible nod to Dubois.

“He paid for that box in cash for five years after he left,” Silas added. “Always kept it open. Like he was waiting for something.”

An hour later, armed with a warrant from a local judge, they had the records from the post office. The box had been closed a decade ago. But there was a forwarding address. Not to a home, but to the general delivery at a university library in Toronto. And it was under a new name. A new alias.

As they drove back down the coast, the setting sun breaking through the clouds to cast a blood-red light on the water, Maya held the small wooden bird in her hand. Ethan wasn’t just a ghost; he was a shapeshifter. A survivor who had spent twenty-five years not just hiding, but preparing. He had transformed himself from a traumatized boy into a skilled artisan, and then into something else entirely.

She looked out at the cold, unforgiving Atlantic, the same ocean that lapped at the shores of Blackwood Island, and she understood. He wasn’t just leaving a trail. He was showing me the man he had to become.
