# Chapter 8: New Purpose

The Portland FBI field office felt like stepping into a different world from the gothic mansion on Blackwood Island. Clean lines, fluorescent lighting, and the steady hum of purposeful activity replaced the oppressive atmosphere of family secrets and suppressed memories. Maya Chen adjusted the strap of her laptop bag and approached the reception desk, her investigator's instincts automatically cataloging exits, security cameras, and the general layout.

"Maya Chen to see Agent Martinez," she told the receptionist, surprised by how steady her voice sounded. Three weeks ago, she'd been a desperate private investigator running from her past. Today, she was here as an FBI consultant.

Agent Sarah Martinez appeared within minutes—a woman in her forties with graying hair pulled back in a practical ponytail and intelligent brown eyes that reminded Maya of Detective Park. "Ms. Chen, welcome to the team. Ready to see what we're dealing with?"

Maya followed Agent Martinez through a maze of cubicles to a conference room where the walls were covered with photographs, timelines, and connecting strings that looked like something from a crime thriller. At the center of it all was a large photograph of Dr. Richard Blackwood.

"Lord have mercy," Maya whispered, her Southern drawl emerging as it always did when she was overwhelmed.

"Twenty-three potential victims over twenty-five years," Agent Martinez said, gesturing to the evidence wall. "That we know of so far. Dr. Blackwood kept meticulous records, which is both helpful and horrifying."

A younger man with dark hair and wire-rimmed glasses looked up from a laptop. "Agent David Kim, digital forensics," he introduced himself. "I've been going through Dr. Blackwood's files. The man documented everything—patient sessions, medication regimens, even what he called 'memory modification protocols.'"

Maya stared at the wall, taking in photographs of children and teenagers, missing person reports, and medical files. Her own eight-year-old face looked back at her from one corner, a therapy intake photo she didn't remember posing for.

"The pattern is consistent," Agent Martinez continued. "Wealthy families with troubled children. Parents desperate for help. Dr. Blackwood positioned himself as a specialist in childhood trauma and behavioral issues."

"But he wasn't helping them," Maya said, her voice flat. "He was selecting victims."

"Exactly. And you're the key to understanding his methods because you survived the process and recovered your memories."

Patricia Valdez, the Morrison family's lawyer, entered the room carrying a stack of files. "Maya, good to see you again. I've been coordinating with families who've agreed to speak with the investigation. Your first contact is the Hendricks family from Vermont."

Agent Martinez handed Maya a file. "Michael Hendricks, age twelve when he disappeared fifteen years ago. Parents took him to Dr. Blackwood for what they were told was innovative therapy for ADHD and behavioral issues."

Maya opened the file and saw a school photo of a boy with sandy hair and a gap-toothed grin. Her chest tightened. "What happened to him?"

"That's what we need you to help us find out. The parents have been searching for answers for fifteen years. They deserve to know the truth."

Maya studied the file, her investigative mind automatically organizing the information. "The family profile fits. Wealthy, isolated, desperate for help with a child they couldn't control through conventional means."

"Your insights into Dr. Blackwood's victim selection and methods have been invaluable," Agent Martinez said. "You see patterns we missed because you understand his psychology from the inside."

Maya looked around the room at the evidence of decades of systematic abuse. "Every family deserves to know what happened to their child. If my experience can help them find answers, then maybe something good can come from all this."

Agent Kim pulled up a digital timeline on his laptop. "We've identified three distinct phases in Dr. Blackwood's operation. Early years focused on local families. Middle period expanded to wealthy families from across New England. Final phase became more sophisticated with the memory suppression techniques."

"He was perfecting his methods," Maya realized. "Learning what worked, what didn't. Getting better at covering his tracks."

"Which is why your perspective is crucial," Agent Martinez said. "You experienced his techniques firsthand. You can help us understand what other families went through."

Maya felt a familiar mix of anger and determination rising in her chest. "What do you need me to do?"

"Start with the Hendricks family. Use your trauma-informed approach to make contact. Help them understand that we believe them, that we're taking their case seriously. And see if you can identify any similarities to your own experience."

That evening, Maya sat in her meticulously organized Boston apartment, surrounded by case files spread across her dining table. The familiar ritual of investigation felt different now—instead of working alone, she was part of a team seeking justice for multiple families.

Her phone rang, and Dr. Sarah Chen's name appeared on the screen.

"How was your first day?" Dr. Chen asked.

Maya leaned back in her chair, looking at the photographs of missing children scattered across her table. "Overwhelming. Twenty-three potential victims, Sarah. Twenty-three families who've been living with unanswered questions."

"That's a heavy burden to carry. How are you processing it?"

"I keep thinking about that little boy I was, hiding in those passages, making promises I was too young to understand. Now I have the chance to keep those promises for other children."

"It's natural to want to help, Maya. But remember that you can't save everyone. Your role is to provide insight and support, not to carry the weight of every family's pain."

Maya picked up Michael Hendricks's school photo. "I know. But when I look at these faces, I see myself. I see Sarah. I see Danny Morrison. These children deserved better."

"They did. And now you're helping ensure they get justice. That's powerful healing work, but it needs to be balanced with your own self-care."

After the call, Maya prepared for her first victim family contact. She reviewed the Hendricks file again, noting the similarities to her own case—the family's desperation, Dr. Blackwood's promises of innovative treatment, the child's subsequent disappearance.

The next morning, she set up her laptop for a video call with Carol and Robert Hendricks. Her hands were steady as she dialed, but her heart raced with the weight of what she was about to discuss.

A woman with graying blonde hair and tired eyes appeared on the screen, followed by a man with a weathered face and the hollow look of someone who'd been searching for answers too long.

"Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks, I'm Maya Chen with the FBI investigation into Dr. Richard Blackwood. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me."

Carol Hendricks leaned forward. "We've been waiting fifteen years for someone to believe us. Michael wasn't just a runaway. Something happened to him on that island."

"I believe you," Maya said simply. "And I want to help you find the truth about what happened to Michael."

Robert Hendricks's voice was rough with emotion. "The police said he ran away. Said troubled kids do that. But Michael wouldn't have left without telling us. He was scared of Dr. Blackwood by the end."

"Can you tell me about the therapy sessions? What Dr. Blackwood told you about Michael's treatment?"

Carol's hands twisted in her lap. "He said Michael had severe ADHD with oppositional defiant disorder. Said traditional therapy wasn't working and he needed intensive intervention. He convinced us to let Michael stay on the island for a week-long intensive program."

Maya's chest tightened. "And when you picked him up?"

"He was different," Robert said. "Quiet. Withdrawn. Said he didn't remember much about the week. Dr. Blackwood said that was normal, that the therapy was intensive and Michael needed time to process."

"But he got worse at home," Carol added. "Nightmares, panic attacks. He kept saying he needed to remember something important but couldn't. We took him back to Dr. Blackwood twice more."

Maya felt sick. "And after the third visit?"

"He disappeared that night. Left his room sometime after midnight. We found his window open, but there was no note, no sign of where he went. The police found his jacket by the river two days later."

"But no body," Maya said.

"No body. They said he probably drowned, but we never believed it. Michael was an excellent swimmer. And he was terrified of water after the therapy sessions."

Maya made careful notes, recognizing the pattern. "Mrs. Hendricks, I need to ask you something difficult. Did Michael ever mention specific details about what happened during the therapy? Any fragments of memory?"

Carol's eyes filled with tears. "He said he remembered being in a dark place underground. Said there were other children there, but they were sleeping. He kept asking about a boy named Tommy, but we didn't know any Tommy."

Maya's breath caught. Tommy Morrison. Even fifteen years ago, Michael had somehow retained fragments of memory about Tommy's murder.

"Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks, I want you to know that we're taking Michael's case very seriously. Dr. Blackwood has been arrested and is facing federal charges. We believe he harmed many children over the years, and we're committed to finding out what happened to all of them."

Robert leaned forward. "Do you think... do you think Michael might still be alive?"

Maya chose her words carefully. "I think Michael deserves justice, whatever happened to him. And I think you deserve answers. I'm going to do everything I can to help you find them."

After the call, Maya sat in her apartment feeling the weight of the Hendricks family's fifteen-year search for their son. She thought about Carol's description of Michael's nightmares, his fragments of memory about underground spaces and sleeping children.

The next day, she returned to the FBI field office with her notes and observations.

"The pattern is consistent," she told Agent Martinez and Agent Kim. "Memory suppression therapy, underground locations, references to other children. Michael Hendricks retained fragments, just like I did."

Agent Martinez studied Maya's notes. "The underground references are interesting. We've been planning a search of Blackwood Island, but we haven't identified specific locations."

"I can help with that," Maya said. "I remember the basement levels, the hidden passages. If Dr. Blackwood was keeping children there, I know where to look."

Agent Kim pulled up architectural plans on his laptop. "We've obtained the original mansion blueprints, but they don't show any basement levels beyond basic storage."

"That's because the passages were added later," Maya said. "Probably when Dr. Blackwood started his operation. They're not on any official plans."

Agent Martinez made notes. "We'll need to coordinate with Maine authorities for the search. And Maya, we'll need you there to guide us."

Maya felt a chill at the thought of returning to Blackwood Island, but she nodded. "Whatever it takes to find these children."

"There's something else," Agent Kim said. "We've identified a pattern in Dr. Blackwood's patient selection. He specifically targeted families with children who had witnessed traumatic events or had behavioral issues that made them less likely to be believed."

"He was choosing victims who were already vulnerable," Maya realized. "Children whose credibility was already questioned."

"Exactly. And he used his medical authority to convince parents that memory suppression was therapeutic, not criminal."

Agent Martinez handed Maya another file. "Your next family contact is the Washingtons from Connecticut. Their daughter Emma disappeared twelve years ago after therapy with Dr. Blackwood."

Maya opened the file and saw a photograph of a girl with dark curls and serious eyes. Another child who deserved justice. Another family who deserved answers.

"I'll call them this afternoon," Maya said. "And Agent Martinez? Thank you for believing in this. For taking it seriously."

"Thank you for having the courage to come forward. Without your testimony and insights, Dr. Blackwood might never have been stopped."

As Maya left the FBI office that day, she felt something she hadn't experienced in years: a sense of purpose that went beyond her own healing. She was part of something larger now, a mission to find justice for children who couldn't speak for themselves.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Detective Park: "Saw the news about the federal investigation. Proud of you for turning your pain into purpose. Those families are lucky to have you fighting for them."

Maya smiled as she walked to her car. For the first time since recovering her memories, she felt like the scared eight-year-old hiding in those passages had grown into someone who could fight back. Someone who could keep the promises that little girl had made.

The investigation was just beginning, but Maya Chen was ready for whatever came next. She had found her new purpose: giving voice to the voiceless and ensuring that Dr. Richard Blackwood's victims would finally get the justice they deserved.
