# Chapter 6: The Choice

The phone kept ringing.

Maya stared at Dr. Richard, at the syringe in his hand, at the unconscious child on the bed. The IV line snaked from the boy's arm like a lifeline that could become a death sentence with one push of Dr. Richard's thumb.

"Choose, Maya," he said softly, his voice carrying the same clinical detachment he'd used twenty-five years ago when he'd wrapped Tommy Morrison's body in a sheet. "Answer that phone, and I increase the sedation. The boy won't wake up. Ever."

Eleanor stood behind him, her aristocratic mask finally cracked, revealing the desperate woman underneath. "Just do it, Richard. End this. We can't let her destroy everything we've built."

James pressed himself against the wall, his face white with horror. "Uncle Richard, please. He's just a child. Like Sarah was. Like they all were."

"Sentiment, James. Always your weakness." Dr. Richard's eyes never left Maya's face. "The phone, Maya. Last chance."

Maya looked at the boy—maybe ten years old, dark hair falling across his pale forehead. His breathing was shallow but steady. Alive. For now.

The phone rang again.

"Detective Park," Maya said quietly, not moving toward the phone. "She's been trying to reach me since yesterday. She knows something's wrong."

"Then she'll find your body on the cliffs tomorrow morning. Tragic suicide, brought on by recovered memories of childhood trauma." Dr. Richard adjusted his grip on the syringe. "The boy will simply... disappear. Another runaway from the mainland. These things happen."

Maya felt the weight of the brass letter opener in her hand. Twenty-five years ago, she'd been a terrified eight-year-old who'd made a promise to keep terrible secrets. But she wasn't that little girl anymore.

"You know what, Dr. Blackwood?" Maya's Southern drawl emerged strong and clear. "Some promises are meant to be broken."

She lunged forward, not toward Dr. Richard, but toward the IV line. Her fingers found the connection and yanked it free from the boy's arm just as Dr. Richard moved to inject more sedative into the bag.

"James!" Maya shouted. "Help me!"

For a moment, James froze. Then something shifted in his face—twenty years of manipulation and fear cracking like ice in spring. He threw himself at his uncle, grabbing for the syringe.

"No more," James said, his voice breaking. "I let you drug my daughter into silence. I let you destroy her mind to protect family secrets. No more."

Dr. Richard stumbled backward, the syringe flying from his hand to shatter against the wall. "You fool! You're destroying everything!"

Maya scooped up the unconscious boy, surprised by how light he was. Too light. How long had Dr. Richard been drugging him? "James, the passage. We need to get him out of here."

Eleanor moved to block their path, her face twisted with rage. "You don't understand what you're destroying. This family has stood for generations. You're ruining everything we represent!"

"You represent nothing but lies and dead children," Maya said, pushing past her toward the hidden door.

Behind them, Dr. Richard was getting to his feet, reaching for his medical bag. "Eleanor, stop them. Whatever it takes."

Maya's phone rang again as they reached the passage. This time, she answered.

"Detective Park?"

"Maya! Thank God. I've been trying to reach you for hours. The ferry's running again, and I'm on my way to the island. Something about this case—"

"Basement," Maya said quickly, carrying the boy into the narrow passage. "Secret room behind the basement wall. Child victim. Come now."

"Maya, what—"

The line went dead as Dr. Richard yanked the phone from her hand and smashed it against the wall.

"You've just signed that boy's death warrant," he said, pulling another syringe from his bag. "And your own."

But Maya was already moving through the passages, James beside her, the boy's weight growing heavier in her arms. Behind them, she could hear Dr. Richard and Eleanor following, their voices echoing in the narrow space.

"This way," James whispered, leading her toward a passage that sloped upward. "There's an exit near the kitchen."

They emerged into the main house to find it eerily quiet. Through the windows, Maya could see the gray afternoon light and, in the distance, the white wake of a boat cutting through the water.

"The ferry," James said. "Detective Park."

Maya laid the boy on the kitchen table, checking his pulse. Still steady, but his breathing was shallow. "How long has he been here?"

"I don't know. I swear to God, Maya, I didn't know about the room. About any of it." James's hands were shaking. "Richard said he was treating disturbed children, helping them with therapy. I thought... I thought he was helping."

"Like he helped me? Like he helped Sarah?"

James's face crumpled. "Sarah tried to tell me. In her last weeks, she kept saying she remembered things from when she was little. About the other children. But Mother said it was impossible, and Richard said it was just the medication making her confused."

"The medication that was supposed to help her remember, not forget."

"Yes. She was getting better, remembering more. And then..." James looked at the unconscious boy. "Oh God. He killed her because she was remembering."

A sound from the basement made them both freeze. Dr. Richard's voice, calling up the stairs: "Maya! I know you're up there. Bring the boy back, and I'll make this quick. For both of you."

Maya looked around the kitchen, her investigator's mind working. They needed to get the boy to safety, but Dr. Richard would be coming up the stairs any moment. And Eleanor was probably destroying evidence in the basement.

"James, can you carry him?"

"Yes, but where—"

"The dock. We meet Detective Park there." Maya grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter. "And James? When the police ask, you tell them everything. Every detail you can remember."

"What about the family? The reputation?"

Maya looked at him steadily. "What about the children?"

James nodded, lifting the boy carefully. "You're right. Sarah would want... she'd want the truth."

They made it to the front door before Dr. Richard appeared at the top of the basement stairs, medical bag in hand. His usually perfect appearance was disheveled, his gray hair wild, his eyes holding a desperate gleam.

"Going somewhere?" he asked pleasantly, as if they were discussing the weather. "I'm afraid I can't let you leave. Not with my patient."

"Your victim, you mean."

"Semantics." Dr. Richard opened his bag, revealing rows of syringes. "The boy is very sick, Maya. He needs treatment. Just like you needed treatment when you were eight years old."

"I wasn't sick. I was traumatized. By you."

"Trauma, illness—sometimes they're the same thing. The mind can be a very dangerous place." He pulled out a syringe filled with clear liquid. "I helped you forget things that would have destroyed your life. I can help you forget again."

Through the window, Maya could see the ferry pulling up to the dock. Figures in uniform were disembarking—Detective Park and backup officers.

"It's over, Dr. Blackwood," Maya said. "The police are here."

"No, it's not over. It's never over." Dr. Richard moved toward them, syringe raised. "This family has protected its interests for generations. We don't let outsiders threaten what we've built."

"By murdering children?"

"By solving problems before they become crises." His voice was calm, clinical, but his hands were shaking. "You were a problem, Maya. You and Sarah both. But I solved Sarah's problem, and I'll solve yours."

James stepped forward, still holding the unconscious boy. "Uncle Richard, stop. Please. This has to stop."

"You're weak, James. You always were. Just like your father." Dr. Richard's attention shifted to his nephew. "But you're family. I can help you forget this conversation ever happened."

"No." James's voice was stronger now. "I choose to remember. I choose Sarah's memory over your lies."

Dr. Richard lunged forward with the syringe, aiming for James's neck. Maya moved without thinking, the kitchen knife in her hand catching the afternoon light as she brought it up to block his attack.

The blade caught Dr. Richard across the wrist, and he dropped the syringe with a cry of pain. Blood splattered across the marble floor—red against white, like truth against lies.

"Maya!"

Detective Park's voice came from the front door, followed by the sound of boots on marble. Maya had never been so happy to hear another human voice.

"In here!" Maya called. "We have an injured child and a suspect!"

Dr. Richard looked around wildly, blood dripping from his wrist. For a moment, Maya thought he might try to run. Then his shoulders sagged, and the fight went out of him.

"Detective Park," he said, his voice regaining some of its professional composure. "I'm Dr. Richard Blackwood. I'm afraid we have a situation here. Ms. Chen has had a psychological breakdown and attacked me. She's been having delusions about—"

"Dr. Blackwood," Detective Park interrupted, her voice sharp with authority. "You're under arrest for multiple counts of child abuse, murder, and conspiracy."

Dr. Richard's mouth fell open. "I beg your pardon?"

"Maya's been in contact with us for days. We've been building a case." Detective Park nodded to the officers behind her. "Take him into custody. And get that child to a hospital immediately."

As the officers moved to arrest Dr. Richard, Maya felt something she hadn't experienced in twenty-five years: the weight of secrets lifting from her shoulders.

"Maya," Detective Park said quietly. "Are you all right?"

Maya looked at the unconscious boy in James's arms, at Dr. Richard being handcuffed, at the blood on the marble floor. She thought about eight-year-old Maya, hiding in the passages, making promises she was too young to understand.

"I am now," she said. "I finally am."

Eleanor appeared in the doorway, her silver hair disheveled, her aristocratic composure completely gone. "What is the meaning of this? This is private property. You have no right—"

"Mrs. Blackwood," Detective Park said. "You're also under arrest as an accessory to multiple felonies."

"This is preposterous! This family has stood for generations. We've done nothing wrong!"

Maya looked at her steadily. "You protected a monster and became one yourself."

As Eleanor was led away in handcuffs, still protesting her innocence, Maya felt James touch her arm.

"Thank you," he said quietly. "For Sarah. For all of them."

Maya nodded, watching the unconscious boy being loaded into an ambulance. "It's not over yet. There might be others. Other families, other victims."

"Then we'll find them," Detective Park said. "All of them."

Maya Chen had come to this island as a confused, desperate woman running from her past. She was leaving as someone who had finally faced it—and won.

The ferry horn sounded in the distance, calling them home.
