# Chapter 13: The Hunt

The children emerged from the caves like ghosts returning to the world of the living.

Maya supported Emma Washington, whose legs barely held her after twelve years underground. Around them, the FBI's rescue operation transformed the Blackwood Estate into a battlefield of salvation—medical helicopters landing on the manicured lawns, paramedics rushing with stretchers, the mechanical efficiency of saving lives contrasting with the Gothic mansion's brooding presence.

"The lady from the dreams," Emma kept whispering, clutching Maya's hand. "You came back."

"I came back," Maya confirmed, her voice thick. "And you're safe now. All of you are safe."

Agent Martinez coordinated the chaos with practiced authority, his radio crackling with updates. "Three more choppers inbound. Priority evac for the coma patients. Get those IVs secured!"

Through the mansion's tall windows, Maya caught movement. Eleanor Blackwood stood in the library, watching the destruction of her family's legacy with an expression of cold fury. Then she turned away, and Maya saw the flicker of flames.

"She's burning evidence," Maya said sharply.

Martinez followed her gaze. "Kim, take a team. Secure Eleanor Blackwood immediately."

"I'm coming with you," Maya said.

"Maya, you need to—"

"I need to see this through." Her Southern drawl emerged hard as iron. "That woman stood by while children died. While Tommy died. I'm not letting her destroy one more piece of evidence."

James Blackwood approached them, his face haggard but determined. "I'll help however I can. Sarah would want... she'd want the truth to come out. All of it."

Maya studied him—this broken man who'd finally chosen truth over family. "The basement. Your mother keeps the family papers in the basement safe. Sarah mentioned it in her diary."

"I'll show you," James said immediately.

They burst into the mansion as smoke began seeping from the library. Eleanor stood before the fireplace, feeding documents into the flames with methodical precision. Her silver hair was perfectly coiffed, her posture regal even in the act of destruction.

"Step away from the fireplace," Agent Martinez commanded.

Eleanor didn't even turn. "This is private property. You have no right—"

"We have every right," Maya interrupted, moving closer. "Eighteen children, Eleanor. We found eighteen children in those caves. And five bodies."

Now Eleanor turned, her aristocratic features twisted with contempt. "You always were too persistent for your own good. Even as a child. Richard said you'd be trouble."

"So you do remember me."

"Of course I remember you." Eleanor's laugh was bitter. "The little girl who wouldn't forget. Richard had to work so hard to fix what you'd seen. To protect this family from your memories."

"Protect?" Maya's voice shook with rage. "Tommy Morrison was ten years old. He was trying to save the others when Richard shot him. And you were there. You watched."

Something flickered in Eleanor's eyes—not remorse, but annoyance. "Richard went too far that night. I told him the boy just needed more time in the program. But Richard always was... impulsive when challenged."

Agent Kim had circled behind Eleanor during the exchange. At Martinez's signal, he moved forward with handcuffs. "Eleanor Blackwood, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder, child endangerment, and—"

"You've destroyed a legacy spanning generations," Eleanor spat as the handcuffs clicked. "Richard was preserving something pure in this polluted world. Those children... they were chosen. Special."

"They were victims," Maya said quietly. "And Richard? Where is he, Eleanor?"

Eleanor's smile was sharp as winter. "Gone where you'll never find him. He has friends, you know. People who understand his work. Who value what he's preserved."

Agent Martinez stepped forward. "Check her laptop. Kim, get our tech people on those burned documents—see what we can recover."

As they led Eleanor away, she paused beside Maya. "You think you've won? You have no idea how deep this goes. Richard's work will continue, with or without him."

Maya met her gaze steadily. "Not if I can help it."

The laptop yielded immediate results. "Encrypted communications," Agent Kim reported. "But I can see travel bookings. Private jet scheduled to depart from Thomaston Airfield. Destination: São Paulo, Brazil."

"When?" Martinez demanded.

"Three hours from now."

"That's not enough time. He left at dawn according to—" Maya stopped. "Captain Murphy. He saw Richard at dawn. At the harbor."

They found Murphy at the ferry dock, supervising the transport of medical supplies to the island. His weathered face was grim.

"Saw him at dawn, miss," Murphy confirmed. "Loading medical cases onto the Blackwood yacht. Looked like the devil himself was chasing him."

"Which direction?" Agent Martinez asked.

"South. But here's the thing—he wasn't heading for open water. Stayed close to the coast. If he wanted international waters, he'd have gone east."

Maya's mind raced. Something about the route nagged at her—a memory just out of reach. "He's not trying to sail to Brazil. He's going somewhere else first."

"Where?" Martinez asked.

The memory clicked. "The summer house. Lord have mercy, I can't believe I forgot. The Blackwoods have a mainland property. Sarah and I went there once as children. It's isolated, private beach access..." She grabbed Martinez's arm. "That's where he's staging from. He'll have supplies there, documents, everything he needs for a longer run."

Martinez was already on his radio. "All units, we need immediate transport to—" He looked at Maya.

"Pemaquid Point. The old Hartley estate—the Blackwoods bought it in the eighties."

The Coast Guard cutter sliced through gray waters as Maya guided them along the remembered coastline. Her childhood memories were proving more reliable than any map—each inlet and rocky point triggering cascades of recovered images.

"There," she pointed to a secluded cove. "The yacht."

The Blackwood yacht bobbed at anchor, empty. On the shore, a path led up through pine trees to a weathered shingle house. Maya could see fresh tire tracks in the gravel drive.

"Tactical team takes point," Martinez ordered. "Maya, you stay—"

"I know the house layout," Maya interrupted. "I've been here before."

Martinez studied her, then nodded. "Stay behind the team."

But the house was empty, recently abandoned. Medical equipment sat half-packed in the living room. Files were scattered across the dining table—patient records, financial documents, and something that made Maya's blood run cold.

"'The Collectors' Circle,'" she read from an ornate letterhead. "International Society for the Preservation of Innocence."

"Jesus," Martinez breathed. "It's a whole network."

Agent Kim was checking the documents. "Correspondence from Brazil, Thailand, Romania. They're not just hiding him—they want his research. His methods."

"Trail's still warm," the tactical team leader reported. "Maybe thirty minutes ahead of us."

Maya found herself at the window, looking out at the view she'd seen twenty-five years ago. Sarah beside her, both of them eight years old, playing while the adults talked in serious voices. She remembered now—Dr. Richard meeting with other men, discussing "the project" while Eleanor served tea.

"The airfield," she said suddenly. "He's not driving to Thomaston. There's a private strip about ten miles inland. The family used it for—"

Martinez was already moving. "All units converge on—"

"Pemaquid Aviation. Old crop duster field converted for private use."

The race to the airfield was a blur of sirens and speed. Maya gripped the door handle as Martinez pushed the SUV to its limits, other units falling in behind them. The radio chattered with updates—state police establishing roadblocks, air support twenty minutes out.

"We've got Coast Guard, FBI, local police, and air support," Martinez said grimly. "He's not getting away."

They crested a hill and saw it—a small Cessna on the runway, props already spinning. A figure in a dark coat was climbing the stairs.

"That's him," Maya breathed.

The FBI vehicles roared onto the airfield as the plane began to taxi. For a moment, it seemed they were too late. Then the pilot saw the convoy of law enforcement vehicles surrounding the runway. The plane slowed, stopped.

Dr. Richard Blackwood stepped out onto the stairs, his silver hair catching the light. Even from a distance, Maya could see his expression—not fear, but irritation. As if this were merely an inconvenience.

"Dr. Richard Blackwood," Agent Martinez's voice boomed through the megaphone. "You are under arrest. Step away from the aircraft with your hands visible."

Richard descended slowly, his movements deliberate and controlled. As tactical officers surrounded him, his gaze found Maya across the tarmac. He smiled—the same paternal smile she remembered from childhood, the one that had made her trust him even as he stole her memories.

"Hello, Maya," he said as they cuffed him. "I wondered if it would be you. You always were special. Such a strong mind. Such persistent memories."

"It's over," Maya said.

"Is it?" Richard's smile didn't waver. "You found some of them. Saved some of them. But do you really think I worked alone all these years? Do you think the families who sent their 'difficult' children to me didn't know, on some level, what I offered? A chance to start over. To have the child they wanted instead of the one they got."

"You murdered children," Maya said flatly.

"I preserved them. In their perfect state. Before the world could corrupt them." His eyes gleamed with fervor. "And there are others who understand. Who will continue the work."

Agent Martinez stepped between them. "That's enough. Get him in the car."

As they led Richard away, he called back to Maya. "Ask yourself why your parents really sent you to Dr. Webb. What did they want erased? What kind of child did they want instead?"

Maya stood frozen as the words hit home. Martinez touched her shoulder gently. "He's trying to get in your head. Don't let him."

But the seed was planted. As they drove back toward justice and whatever came next, Maya found herself thinking not of Richard or Eleanor, but of her parents. Of a phone call she needed to make. Of questions that demanded answers.

The hunt was over. But the deeper investigation—into her own past, her own family's choices—had just begun.
