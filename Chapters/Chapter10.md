# Chapter 10: Fragments of Memory

The children were singing again.

Maya jerked awake at 3:17 AM, her sheets soaked with sweat, the echo of young voices still reverberating in her skull. The melody was hauntingly simple, a nursery rhyme twisted into something darker:

*Come to the hollow shore, come to the hollow shore,*
*Where the lost children go, where they sing forevermore.*

Her hands were shaking as she reached for the bedside lamp. The sudden light revealed something that made her blood run cold—her sketchpad was open on the nightstand, filled with drawings she didn't remember making.

"Lord have mercy," she whispered, her Southern drawl thick with sleep and fear. "What in the Sam Hill..."

The sketches showed a network of tunnels, drawn with an architect's precision despite being rendered in the dark. Curved passages that seemed to breathe on the page, opening into larger chambers where small figures huddled together. At the bottom of one drawing, her sleeping hand had written: "The hollow shore is underneath."

Maya's fingers traced the lines. These weren't random nightmare images. The level of detail—the way the passages connected, the specific markers she'd drawn—spoke of memory, not imagination. Her subconscious had been trying to tell her something, using the only language it could while her conscious mind slept.

She grabbed her phone and opened her case files, comparing her drawings to the descriptions from the victim families. Emma Washington's mother had mentioned her daughter's obsessive sketches of underground places. Lucas Chen had asked about tunnels where children were calling him. Sofia Rodriguez had heard singing from below.

They all matched. Every single one.

Maya's phone showed seventeen missed calls from her mother over the past two days. She'd been ignoring them, but now she wondered if her mother sensed what was happening. Could feel her daughter pulling at the threads of the carefully woven lies that had held for twenty-five years.

Instead of calling her mother back, Maya scrolled to Dr. Sarah Chen's number. It was early, but this couldn't wait.

"Dr. Chen? It's Maya. I need an emergency session. The memories... they're coming back on their own."

Three hours later, Maya sat in her apartment, laptop open to Dr. Chen's concerned face on the video call. The therapist had cleared her morning schedule, recognizing the urgency in Maya's voice.

"Tell me about the dreams," Dr. Chen said gently.

Maya described the singing, the tunnels, the overwhelming sense of being underground. "It's not just visual. I can smell it—seawater mixed with earth, something organic and old. I can feel the cold stone under my hands."

"Those are very specific sensory memories," Dr. Chen noted. "Your mind is ready to remember. We can work with this, but I want to try EMDR. Are you comfortable with that?"

Maya nodded. She'd used the eye movement technique with trauma victims during her police days, but being on the receiving end felt different. Vulnerable.

"Focus on the strongest sensory memory," Dr. Chen instructed, beginning the bilateral stimulation. "Let your mind follow where it wants to go."

Maya closed her eyes, following the therapist's guidance. The smell came first—salt and decay, the particular mustiness of spaces that never saw sunlight. Then the feeling of Sarah's small hand in hers.

"We found the best secret place," young Sarah's voice echoed across the years. "Uncle Richard doesn't know about the old caves. Nobody does except us."

The memory sharpened. Two eight-year-old girls, flashlights cutting through absolute darkness, following passages that had been carved by smugglers a century ago. The caves ran beneath the entire island, a hidden world that adults had forgotten.

"There's something else," Maya said, her voice strained. "We weren't alone down there. We found—" The memory fractured, her mind still protecting her from the worst of it.

"That's enough for now," Dr. Chen said firmly. "You remembered the caves. That's significant progress."

"Smuggler's caves," Maya said, opening her eyes. "That's what Sarah called them. They run under Blackwood Island. That's where... that's where something happened."

"And that's where you think the missing children might be?"

Maya nodded, unable to speak past the tightness in her throat.

After the session, Maya threw herself into research with the single-minded focus that had made her a good detective. If she was going to return to those caves—and she knew she would have to—she needed to understand everything about her own past first.

She created an investigation board on her living room wall, treating her own history like a cold case. At the center, she pinned the photograph of herself and Sarah at the hollow shore. Around it, she began building a timeline.

The Columbia, South Carolina archives yielded results within hours. Dr. Marcus Webb had been a prominent child psychiatrist in 1998, specializing in trauma-related memory disorders. What Maya found next made her stomach turn.

"Therapeutic Memory Modification in Traumatized Children" by Dr. Marcus Webb and Dr. Richard Blackwood, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1997.

She read excerpts aloud, her voice growing harder with each word: "When a child experiences trauma that threatens their psychological stability, selective memory suppression can be a therapeutic tool. Using a combination of guided imagery, pharmaceutical intervention, and structured therapy, specific traumatic memories can be effectively compartmentalized..."

"They wrote a damn manual," Maya said to her empty apartment. "A blueprint for stealing memories."

Her phone rang. Her mother again. This time Maya answered.

"Maya, honey, I've been trying to reach you—"

"Did you know?" Maya interrupted. "When you sent me to Dr. Webb, did you know he was connected to the Blackwood family?"

The silence stretched so long Maya thought the call had dropped.

"Some things are better left buried," her mother finally said, the same phrase she'd used before.

"I was eight years old," Maya's voice cracked. "I was eight, and you let them take my memories. You let them steal part of who I was."

"We were trying to protect you—"

Maya hung up. She couldn't do this now. Not when she was so close to the truth.

Her search turned to her parents' employment records. What she found made her sink onto her couch, legs suddenly unable to hold her. In 1998, both her parents had been employed by the Blackwood Foundation, a charitable organization that funded mental health research.

The same foundation that had funded Dr. Webb's practice.

The same foundation that had paid for her "therapeutic intervention."

By late afternoon, Maya sat in the FBI field office, her personal revelations spread across the conference table. Agent Martinez and Agent Kim studied the materials with professional intensity.

"The cave system is real," Agent Kim confirmed, pulling up historical surveys on his laptop. "Extensive smuggling operations in the 1800s. The caves were supposedly sealed in the 1920s, but..."

"But a family that's owned the island for three generations would know how to access them," Agent Martinez finished.

Maya forced herself to maintain professional composure. "Based on my recovered memories and the victim descriptions, I believe that's where Dr. Richard took the children. The 'hollow shore' isn't a metaphorical place—it's literal. Somewhere in those caves."

"You realize what you're suggesting," Agent Martinez said carefully. "If the children were taken to the caves..."

"They might still be there," Maya finished. "After all these years, they might still be there."

Agent Kim was already pulling up ground-penetrating radar specifications. "We'll need a full search team. Forensics, cave rescue specialists, the works."

"Maya," Agent Martinez's voice was gentle. "Are you prepared to go back there? To the actual site of your trauma?"

Maya thought of the twenty-three families waiting for answers. Of Emma Washington's drawings and Lucas Chen's questions about underground voices. Of Sofia Rodriguez, who heard children singing where no children should be.

"I'm the only one who's been in those caves and lived to remember it," Maya said. "Even if that memory was stolen for twenty-five years. Yes, I'm prepared."

As the FBI team began coordinating the search operation, Maya stepped outside for air. The photo of her and Sarah was in her pocket, and she pulled it out, studying their innocent faces.

"I'm coming back, Sarah," she whispered. "I'm finally coming back to the hollow shore."

Her phone buzzed with a text from Dr. Chen: "Remember, recovering memories is like archaeology. Each layer reveals more, but some discoveries can be devastating. I'm here when you need me."

Maya tucked the photo away and walked back into the building. Act Two of her investigation had begun, and this time, she wasn't just hunting for a killer.

She was hunting for her own stolen past.
