# Chapter 15: The Devil's Logic

The interrogation room was a sterile box of beige and steel, designed to strip away pretense. But Dr. Richard Blackwood brought his own atmosphere with him. He sat at the metal table, not in a prisoner's slump, but with the relaxed posture of a tenured professor about to lead a seminar.

"He's going to use everything he knows about you, Maya," Agent Martinez warned from the observation room, his voice a low growl in her earpiece. "Every weakness, every fear. You don't have to do this."

"I know," Maya said, her own voice calm and steady, a thin layer of ice over the churning sea of emotion left by the phone call with her parents. "That's why I have to be in there. He's not just a suspect to me. I'm not just an agent to him. This isn't an interrogation. It's a reckoning."

Martinez nodded, his expression a mixture of concern and respect. "Protocol is, I pull you if I think he's crossing a line."

"He crossed the line twenty-five years ago," Maya replied. "I'll be fine."

She walked in. Richard’s eyes lit up with a warm, genuine-seeming smile. "Maya. I'm so glad we can finally have an honest conversation. No more secrets." He gestured to his lawyer, a man who looked profoundly uncomfortable. "You may wait outside, Arthur. Miss Chen and I have professional matters to discuss."

The lawyer sputtered a protest, but Richard waved him away. It was a calculated move, designed to frame the encounter, to cast them as peers. *Therapist to therapist.*

Maya sat opposite him, her hands folded calmly on the table. She let the silence stretch, refusing to be drawn into his frame.

He broke first, his tone reasonable, professorial. "I imagine you see me as a monster," he began. "It's an understandable, if simplistic, conclusion. But I ask you to set aside the emotion for a moment and consider the logic, the philosophy of my work."

For the next hour, he lectured. He spoke of his "Doctrine of Preservation," a twisted ideology that painted him as a savior. He argued that adulthood was a disease, a "slow, grinding erosion of everything pure," and that he was merely saving children from that inevitable corruption. He referenced his paper, "Therapeutic Memory Modification," not as a blueprint for abuse, but as a sacred text for his new science.

"Think of it, Maya," he said, his eyes gleaming with fervor. "An eternity of perfect, unsullied innocence. The Integration Suite wasn't a place of horror; it was a sanctuary. An archive of perfect souls, preserved at the peak of their beauty, before the world could tarnish them."

Maya listened, her face a mask of professional neutrality. Inside, she was a maelstrom of rage and disgust. This man, this monster, was calmly justifying the systematic destruction of lives, framing it as a noble crusade.

"And Tommy Morrison?" she asked, her voice dangerously quiet.

Richard sighed, a theatrical display of regret. "A tragedy. But a necessary one. Tommy had become a contamination. His rebellious spirit, his desire for the 'outside,' threatened the integrity of the entire cohort. His removal was akin to a surgical procedure—excising a cancer to save the patient. It was for the greater good of the other specimens."

*Specimens.* The word hung in the air, cold and clinical.

"You, of all people, should understand," he continued, leaning forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You, with your own fractured past. You understand the desire to edit memory, to remove the painful parts. I was simply offering that gift to everyone."

He was trying to make her an accomplice in his logic, to find common ground in the shared landscape of trauma. It was his fatal mistake.

"I remember the tank," Maya said, her voice flat, devoid of the emotion he was trying to provoke. The sudden shift from philosophical debate to direct testimony made him blink. "I remember the water was the exact temperature of my skin, so I couldn't tell where my body ended and the darkness began. I remember the smell of the antiseptic solution you used. It smelled like bitter almonds."

Richard’s smile tightened. "The details are unimportant—"

"I remember you telling me to forget the sound of the waves," she pressed on, her voice gaining strength. "You said the water was a bad memory. But I remember the salt on my skin. I remember Sarah holding my hand right before they took her to her session. I remember her whispering, 'Don't forget me.' That's what you took, Richard. Not 'impurities.' You took names. You took hands."

She leaned forward, her eyes locking onto his. "What about Emma Washington's drawings? Was her talent an impurity you needed to 'preserve'? Or Lucas Chen's love for astronomy? Did you archive the way he could name all the constellations?"

She was humanizing them, turning his precious "specimens" back into children. His composure began to crack, a faint flush rising on his neck.

"And what about Project Nightingale?" Maya asked, delivering the killing blow. "What about Mr. Alistair and his friends in Romania? How did selling your 'preserved consciousnesses' to the highest bidder fit into your noble vision?"

The mask didn't just slip; it shattered. For the first time, Maya saw the raw, narcissistic rage beneath the charming facade.

"They're not just collectors!" he snarled, his voice losing its professorial calm. "They are patrons! Visionaries! They understand that what I create is art. A gallery of perfect, untarnished souls, more beautiful than any Rembrandt or Da Vinci! They paid to support the work, to ensure its continuation!"

"They paid for children," Maya corrected him softly.

"They paid for perfection!" he roared, slamming his hand on the table. "And Sarah... Sarah was to be my masterpiece. The culmination of twenty-five years of research. Her artistic soul, her sensitivity... she was the perfect canvas. Her death was a tragic interruption of my most important work!"

He had finally admitted it. Sarah hadn't been killed to protect a secret. She had been killed because she was trying to escape her own "preservation."

Realizing he had said too much, Richard visibly reined himself in. The rage vanished, replaced by a chilling, pitying calm. He looked at her, and his expression was the most terrifying thing she had seen yet. It was the look of a god regarding a flawed, broken creation.

"I see they've already gotten to you," he said, his voice dripping with false sympathy. "Your parents. Did they tell you their version of the story? The one that makes them feel better?"

Maya stiffened, the fresh wound from last night's phone call suddenly raw again.

"Your father told you they were scared," Richard continued, his smile twisting. "It's a sweet story. It absolves them. But fear is rarely the whole truth, is it, Maya? Sometimes, it's just a convenient excuse for something much... uglier."

He leaned back, a triumphant gleam in his eye. "They brought you to me—well, to my associate—for a reason. There was something in you they wanted 'fixed.' Something you were doing, something you were becoming, that didn't fit their idea of a perfect daughter."

The door burst open and Martinez stormed in, his face a thundercloud. "This interview is over. Get him out of here."

As two agents hauled a smiling Dr. Richard to his feet, he locked eyes with Maya one last time.

"Ask me again when you're ready to hear what they really wanted to erase," he called out. "The truth is so much more interesting than their little story."

Maya sat frozen in the chair, the silence of the room ringing in her ears. She had won the interrogation, extracted the confession, exposed the network. But in his final, parting shot, the devil had planted a seed of poison, and she could feel it already starting to take root.
