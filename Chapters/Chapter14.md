# Chapter 14: The Aftermath

The FBI’s Portland field office was a maelstrom of controlled chaos. The air hummed with the energy of a massive, unfolding investigation, the kind that agents spent entire careers hoping for or dreading. For Maya, it was both.

Agent Martinez, looking like he hadn’t slept in a week but running on pure adrenaline, led her through the bustling main floor. "Welcome to the hornet's nest," he said, his voice a low rumble against the noise. "We've got teams spinning up to run down every lead from the 'Collectors' Circle.' Agent Kim's tech squad is working around the clock on the encrypted drives. It's a goddamn treasure trove of evil."

He pointed to a large bulletin board that had been cleared for their case. It was covered with the faces of the twenty-three children Dr. Richard had documented. Eighteen of them now had green checkmarks. Five had red crosses. Beside each photo, agents were pinning names, dates, and the status of family notifications. Seeing them all together—the living and the dead—was a physical blow.

"You're officially lead consultant on this, Maya," Martinez said, handing her a badge. "Full access. Your insights have been invaluable. No one else has your perspective."

The professional validation was a strange counterpoint to the weight of the faces on the board. She was one of them. A survivor. But she was also the investigator who had brought the darkness to light. The two identities warred within her, a quiet, internal conflict amidst the external storm.

"What's the latest on the international front?" she asked, her voice all business.

"Kim found preliminary lists. Names in Brazil, Thailand, Romania, just like the letters suggested. Wealthy individuals, all with interests in 'alternative medical research' or 'consciousness studies.' We're coordinating with Interpol. This is going to be a long, ugly slog."

Maya nodded, her eyes tracing the connections on the board. "They weren't just his benefactors. They were his market."

"Exactly," Martinez agreed grimly. "Now, you ready for round one with the queen bee?"

Eleanor Blackwood sat in the interrogation room as if she were holding court in her own library. Her posture was perfect, her expression one of bored condescension. A sleek, expensive lawyer sat beside her, radiating an aura of calm, corporate power.

From the observation room, Maya watched with Martinez. "She's going to stonewall," Maya predicted. "She's lived in a bubble of wealth and denial for fifty years. This is just an inconvenience to her."

She was right. For an hour, Eleanor deflected every question with practiced ease, her lawyer objecting to anything that came close to the bone. She spoke of Richard's work in glowing terms, calling it a noble effort to "preserve the fleeting beauty of childhood innocence."

"She actually believes it," Martinez muttered, rubbing his temples.

"Belief is a powerful shield," Maya said. "She's not just protecting Richard; she's protecting the entire worldview that allowed her to live with herself. We need to pierce that shield. Not break it, just poke a hole."

Maya’s mind drifted back to the summer house, to that long-ago afternoon. The smell of salt and roses. The sound of men's voices from the veranda, low and serious. She remembered a name, a strange one that had stuck in her eight-year-old mind.

She leaned forward, pressing the button to speak into Martinez's earpiece. "Ask her about 'Project Nightingale.' Ask her who Mr. Alistair was."

Martinez, trusting her completely, straightened up and re-entered the room. "Mrs. Blackwood," he said, his tone casual, "we have just one more area to cover today. Can you tell us about Project Nightingale?"

The change was instantaneous and profound. Eleanor’s regal composure shattered. Her teacup rattled in its saucer. Her eyes, for the first time, showed a flicker of genuine fear.

"I... I don't know what you're talking about," she stammered.

"And Mr. Alistair?" Martinez pressed gently. "A frequent visitor to your summer home, I believe. From Romania."

"That's enough," the lawyer snapped, standing abruptly. "This interrogation is over. My client is fatigued." He hustled a visibly shaken Eleanor out of the room, but the damage was done.

"Holy shit," Martinez said, returning to the observation room. "What was that?"

"A memory," Maya said, a grim satisfaction settling in her. "A name I wasn't supposed to have heard. Project Nightingale was what they called the international side of the operation. Alistair was one of the first 'collectors.'"

Her victory felt hollow. She needed air. She needed to remember what this was all for.

The children's wing of the Portland hospital was a world away from the cold, sterile FBI office. It was a place of quiet tears, confused reunions, and the first tentative steps toward healing. Maya saw parents holding children they hadn't seen in years, trying to bridge a gulf of trauma with hugs and whispered words.

She found Emma Washington in a sunny room, sitting by the window. The vacant, mechanical look was gone, replaced by a deep, watchful quiet. She was drawing, as always.

"Hi, Emma," Maya said softly.

Emma looked up, a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She didn't speak, but she held out her drawing. It was a picture of a stick-figure girl with dark hair, leading another group of children out of a dark cave and into a bright, yellow sun.

"Thank you," Maya said, her throat tight. "It's beautiful."

A doctor found her in the hallway. "The physical recovery is the easy part," he explained. "The psychological deprogramming... that will take years. They were conditioned to believe the cave was safety, the outside world a threat. Your presence, a familiar face from 'before,' has been a crucial anchor for them."

"And the others?" Maya asked. "The ones who were in comas?"

"Awake and stabilized," the doctor confirmed. "Confused, scared, but alive. You got to them in time."

You found us. Emma’s words echoed in her mind. It was the only absolution she needed.

That night, in the sterile quiet of her hotel room, Maya knew she had to make the call. Dr. Richard’s final, venomous words had been festering for hours. *Ask yourself why your parents really sent you to Dr. Webb.*

She dialed the number, her heart pounding a nervous rhythm against her ribs. Her mother answered, her voice a familiar mix of Southern warmth and anxiety.

"Maya, honey! We saw the news. Are you alright? It's just dreadful."

"I'm fine, Mom," Maya said, cutting to the chase. "They've been arrested. Richard and Eleanor."

"Oh, thank the Lord," her mother breathed.

"Mom," Maya said, her voice steady. "Why did you send me to Dr. Webb?"

The silence on the other end of the line was a confession in itself. "Maya, we've been over this. You were having such terrible nightmares. We were worried. We were just trying to protect you."

"Protect me from what? From what I saw on that island?"

"I... I don't..."

Suddenly, a different voice came on the line, her father's, heavy with a guilt that had been aging for twenty-five years. "Your mother's right, Maya. We were trying to protect you. But... we were protecting ourselves, too."

Maya closed her eyes. "Tell me, Dad."

"You were... a sensitive child," he began, his voice cracking. "After that last summer on the island, you weren't the same. You wouldn't sleep. You drew... awful pictures. You talked about the 'hollow shore' and a boy named Tommy. You said you saw... you saw something bad happen in the caves."

He took a shaky breath. "We were scared. We didn't know what to do. Richard Blackwood was a respected doctor. He said he knew a specialist in Columbia, a Dr. Webb, who could help with childhood trauma. He said he could help you... forget the bad dreams."

"So you let him," Maya whispered, the words tasting like ash. "You let him erase my memories because you were scared."

"We didn't understand what he was really doing, honey, I swear," her father pleaded. "We just wanted our happy little girl back. The one who didn't see monsters in the dark."

The tragedy of it settled on her, a cold, heavy weight. They weren't malicious. They were just weak. They had chosen the easy lie over the hard truth. They had sacrificed her memory for their own peace of mind.

"I have to go," she said, her voice devoid of emotion.

She hung up the phone and stared at the blank hotel wall, feeling a profound and terrible loneliness. The hunt for the Blackwoods was over. But her own hunt, the one into the heart of her own family's secrets, had just begun.
