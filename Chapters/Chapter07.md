# Chapter 7: Aftermath

The police station in Bar Harbor felt like a different world from the gothic mansion on Blackwood Island. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting everything in stark, honest light. Maya sat across from Detective Park and two state investigators, a digital recorder between them capturing every word of her statement.

"Take your time," Detective Park said gently. "I know this is difficult."

Maya looked down at her hands, still bearing small cuts from the brass letter opener. Twenty-four hours ago, she'd been a desperate private investigator running from her past. Now she was the key witness in what the FBI was calling one of the largest child abuse cases in Maine's history.

"I remember everything now," Maya said, her voice steady. "From the time I was eight years old until yesterday. Dr. Richard Blackwood systematically abused children on that island for decades, and when they threatened to tell, he either killed them or used experimental memory suppression therapy to make them forget."

Detective Park nodded. "We've found extensive files in his basement office. Patient records going back twenty-five years. Maya, there may be dozens of victims."

The weight of that settled over the room like a heavy blanket. Dozens of children. Dozens of families who never got answers.

"The boy we found," Maya said. "Danny. How is he?"

"Awake. Asking for his parents." Detective Park's expression softened. "Maya, there's something you need to know about Danny. His last name is Morrison."

Maya's breath caught. "Morrison?"

"Danny Morrison. He's Tommy Morrison's nephew."

The room seemed to tilt. Maya gripped the edge of the table. "Tommy's nephew?"

"The Morrison family has been looking for answers about Tommy's death for twenty-five years. When they learned about Sarah Blackwood's suspicious suicide, they started investigating. They discovered your connection to the island through old therapy records."

Maya stared at Detective Park. "They hired me. The Morrison family hired me."

"That's what it appears," Detective Park said carefully. "Through a lawyer, yes. They knew that if anyone could uncover the truth about what happened on that island, it would be someone who had been there. Someone who might remember."

Maya felt a strange mix of emotions—anger at being manipulated, but also understanding. "They used me."

"They gave you a chance to find justice. For Tommy, for Sarah, for yourself." Detective Park leaned forward. "Maya, you chose to fight back. You chose to save that child. That's not being a victim—that's being a hero."

But even as Detective Park spoke, something nagged at Maya. The sophistication of the manipulation, the precise timing, the way everything had fallen into place so perfectly—it felt almost too orchestrated for a grieving family acting alone.

Before Maya could respond, there was a knock on the door. A young officer entered. "Detective Park? James Blackwood is ready to give his statement."

Maya watched through the one-way glass as James sat in the interview room next door. He looked like he'd aged ten years in the past day. His hands shook as he accepted a cup of coffee from the interviewer.

"I want to tell you everything," James said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Every detail I can remember. Every child who came to the island and... and didn't leave the same."

For the next three hours, James laid out a horrific timeline. Children who had visited the island over the years—some from wealthy families seeking Dr. Richard's "innovative therapy," others like Tommy who had simply seen too much. James named names, provided dates, described the elaborate cover-ups.

"I enabled a monster for twenty years because I was too weak to face the truth," James said, tears streaming down his face. "Sarah died because I chose family loyalty over her safety. I can't undo that, but I can make sure it never happens again."

Maya found herself crying too, watching this broken man finally choose courage over comfort.

Later that evening, Maya sat in the hospital room where Danny Morrison was recovering. He was small for ten, with dark hair like his uncle Tommy had had. His parents, Linda and Mark Morrison, sat beside his bed.

"You're the lady who found me," Danny said when Maya entered. His voice was hoarse but clear.

"I am. How are you feeling?"

"Confused. The doctors say I was sick, but I don't remember being sick. I remember being at camp, and then... nothing until I woke up here."

Linda Morrison reached for Maya's hand. "We can't thank you enough. When we lost Tommy, we thought we'd never get answers. We thought the Blackwoods were untouchable."

"How did you find me?" Maya asked.

Mark Morrison pulled out a folder. "It took years of investigation. We hired private detectives, lawyers, anyone who would listen. When Sarah Blackwood died, we knew it wasn't suicide. We started looking into her background, her therapy records. That's when we found references to other children who had been on the island, including you."

"Your therapy records from when you were eight," Linda added. "Dr. Richard had documented your 'treatment' extensively. We realized you might be the key to understanding what really happened to Tommy."

Maya looked at the folder, seeing photocopies of documents she didn't remember creating. "You've been planning this for how long?"

"Two years," Mark said. "We knew we needed someone on the inside, someone who could investigate without raising suspicion. When we learned you'd become a private investigator, it seemed like fate."

Maya studied the folder, something bothering her. "How did you get access to Dr. Richard's therapy records? Those should have been sealed, protected by doctor-patient privilege."

Mark and Linda exchanged a glance. "Our lawyer... Patricia has connections. She said she had sources who could help."

"Sources?" Maya pressed.

"We didn't ask too many questions," Linda said quickly. "We were just grateful for the help. Sometimes you don't look a gift horse in the mouth when you're desperate for answers."

But Maya's investigative instincts were prickling. The level of access, the sophisticated planning, the way everything had been orchestrated—it suggested resources and knowledge far beyond what a grieving family could typically muster.

"We're sorry we deceived you," Linda continued. "But we were desperate. Tommy was just ten years old when he died. The same age as Danny is now."

Maya looked at Danny, who was listening with wide eyes. "Your uncle Tommy was very brave. He tried to protect other children, and that's why Dr. Blackwood hurt him."

Danny nodded solemnly. "Mom showed me pictures of him. She said he would have been the best uncle ever."

"He would have been," Maya agreed.

The next morning, Maya found herself in a therapist's office in Portland. Dr. Sarah Chen (no relation, despite the shared name) specialized in trauma recovery and memory integration.

"How are you processing everything that's happened?" Dr. Chen asked.

Maya considered the question. "I feel... different. Like I've been carrying this weight my whole life without knowing it, and now it's gone. But also like I'm just beginning to understand who I really am."

"That's very common with recovered memory cases. You're essentially meeting your eight-year-old self for the first time in twenty-five years."

"I keep thinking about the other children. James mentioned at least six others who disappeared or changed dramatically after visiting the island. What if they're out there, living with suppressed memories like I was?"

Dr. Chen nodded. "The FBI has asked me to consult on the broader investigation. They're going to need experts in memory suppression therapy to help identify and support other potential victims."

"I want to help," Maya said immediately. "I want to help find them."

"That's admirable, Maya. But you need to focus on your own healing first. You can't pour from an empty cup."

Maya understood, but she also felt a sense of purpose she'd never experienced before. Her investigative skills, her personal experience, her recovered memories—they could help other people find justice and healing.

That afternoon, she met with the Morrison family's lawyer, Patricia Valdez, in a conference room overlooking Portland's harbor.

"The FBI wants to offer you a consulting position," Patricia said. "Your unique perspective and investigative background make you invaluable to the broader case."

"What would that involve?"

"Working with other families who suspect their children were victims. Helping identify patterns in Dr. Richard's patient files. Possibly testifying in federal court."

Maya thought about Danny Morrison, about Tommy, about Sarah. About all the children whose voices had been silenced.

"I'll do it," she said. "But I have conditions."

"Name them."

"Any other survivors we find get the best trauma therapy available, paid for by the investigation fund. And I want to be involved in developing protocols for memory recovery that prioritize the victims' wellbeing over the legal case."

Patricia smiled. "I think we can arrange that."

As Maya left the meeting, her phone buzzed with a text from Detective Park: "Eleanor Blackwood just confessed to knowing about the abuse. She's cooperating in exchange for a reduced sentence. James is entering witness protection. Dr. Richard is facing federal charges in three states."

Maya stood on the harbor pier, watching the ferry that ran to the outer islands. Somewhere out there, Blackwood Island sat empty now, its secrets finally exposed to the light.

She thought about the scared eight-year-old girl who had hidden in those passages, making promises she was too young to understand. That little girl had grown up to be a woman who could fight back, who could save other children, who could turn trauma into purpose.

But even as she felt this sense of resolution, questions lingered. The Morrison family's explanation felt incomplete, like a puzzle with missing pieces. Someone with extraordinary resources and knowledge had orchestrated her arrival on that island with surgical precision. The timing, the access to sealed records, the way everything had unfolded—it suggested a mastermind operating from the shadows.

Maya Chen had come to that island as a confused, desperate woman running from her past. She was leaving as someone who had finally faced it—and won.

But more than that, she was leaving as someone with a mission: to find the other children, the other survivors, and help them remember that they were not alone. And perhaps, in the process, she would uncover the identity of the puppet master who had set everything in motion.

The ferry horn sounded in the distance, but this time it wasn't calling her away from her past. It was calling her toward her future—and toward answers that still waited to be found.
