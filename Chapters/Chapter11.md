# Chapter 11: Return to the Hollow Shore

The ferry's horn echoed across the gray water like a funeral bell.

Maya stood at the rail, her hands gripping the cold metal so tightly her knuckles had gone white. Behind her, the FBI search team prepared their equipment with military precision, but all she could focus on was the dark smudge of Blackwood Island growing larger through the morning mist.

"You don't have to do this," Agent Martinez said quietly, joining her at the rail. "We have your drawings, your testimony. You could wait on the mainland."

Maya's laugh came out bitter. "Twenty-three children are counting on me remembering the way. I can't fail them like I failed—" She stopped, her Southern drawl thickening. "Like I failed before."

The island materialized from the fog like something from her nightmares. The mansion's Gothic towers pierced the low-hanging clouds, and Maya's body remembered what her mind had tried to forget—the weight of terror, the taste of salt and earth, the sound of children singing in the dark.

"Well, well." Captain Murphy's gravelly voice made her jump. "Figured you'd be back, miss. Some things won't stay buried, no matter how deep you put 'em."

His knowing look made her skin crawl. "You knew, didn't you? About the children?"

Murphy spat over the rail. "Island keeps its secrets. But sometimes..." He glanced at the FBI team. "Sometimes secrets need telling. Your friend Sarah, she understood that at the end."

Before Maya could respond, Agent Kim approached with a tablet showing her sleep-drawings overlaid with satellite imagery. "Your cave entrance should be here, about a quarter mile behind the main house. The ground-penetrating radar shows extensive systems, just like you drew."

Maya traced the tunnels with a trembling finger. Her sleeping mind had mapped them perfectly—every twist, every chamber, every place where the walls had seemed to breathe with malevolent life.

"Lord have mercy," she whispered. "It's all real."

The Blackwood Estate looked different crawling with FBI agents. Crime scene tape fluttered in the ocean breeze, and what had once been an imposing fortress now seemed diminished, its power broken.

Eleanor Blackwood stood in the doorway like a queen surveying her conquered kingdom. Despite the ankle monitor and federal agents flanking her, she maintained her regal bearing.

"Ms. Chen," Eleanor's voice dripped venom. "Come to gloat? You've destroyed three generations of this family with your delusions. I hope you're satisfied."

"Your family destroyed itself," Maya replied, surprised by her own steadiness. "I'm just here to find the children your brother stole."

"Uncle Richard was protecting this family—"

"Mother, stop." James appeared behind Eleanor, looking haggard but determined. "Just stop. Sarah knew the truth. She tried to tell us." He held out a leather journal. "This was Sarah's. From when she was young. She wrote about the caves, about the other children. I... I should have listened."

Maya took the diary with careful hands. Sarah's childish scrawl described "the hollow shore where lost children go" and "Uncle Richard's special place underground." The entries stopped abruptly after their eighth summer.

"Maya?" A hesitant voice called from the side of the house. Margaret Swift, the groundskeeper, emerged from the shadows. "I... I know where the old entrance is. The one the children used to use. Before Dr. Richard had the new passages built."

Agent Martinez stepped forward. "Ma'am, anything you can tell us—"

"I kept quiet for twenty years," Margaret's voice broke. "Told myself it wasn't my business. But Sarah... Sarah was asking questions before she died. About the old smuggling tunnels. About why we weren't allowed in the north woods anymore." She met Maya's eyes. "I'll show you. It's time someone did right by those children."

The path through the woods felt both foreign and familiar. Maya's feet seemed to know the way even as her mind recoiled. The FBI team followed in a careful line, but she barely heard their chatter over the roar of memory.

*Small hands linked together. Sarah's laugh echoing through the trees. "Come on, Maya! I'll show you the secret way!"*

"Here," Maya said suddenly, stopping at a cluster of moss-covered rocks. Her body had moved without conscious thought, muscle memory guiding her to the exact spot. "It's behind these stones."

The cave specialists moved in with practiced efficiency, carefully shifting the rocks that had been recently disturbed. As the entrance revealed itself—a black mouth in the earth—Maya's knees nearly buckled.

The smell hit her first. Seawater and decay, earth and something else. Something wrong.

"This is it," she gasped, her accent thick as molasses. "Lord have mercy, I can still smell it—seawater and earth and... something else. Something wrong."

"Lights have been installed," one of the cave specialists reported. "Recent work, professional grade. This isn't some makeshift operation."

Agent Kim's equipment started beeping. "I'm picking up electronic signatures below. Cameras, maybe. Or monitoring equipment."

"Full protective gear," Agent Martinez ordered. "Maya, you don't have to—"

"Yes, I do." Maya accepted a helmet with built-in camera and light. "Those children have been waiting twenty-five years for someone to remember the way."

The descent into darkness felt like drowning in reverse. Modern LED strips lined the initial passage, their clinical brightness at odds with Maya's memories of flashlight beams and shadow. But the smell remained the same, triggering cascades of fragmented images.

"First chamber coming up," the lead specialist announced.

Maya knew what they'd find before they rounded the corner. The "classroom" materialized exactly as her nightmares had shown—rows of small chairs facing medical equipment that had no place in any legitimate therapy.

"Jesus Christ," Agent Martinez breathed.

"He called it 'integration therapy,'" Maya heard herself say. "Making us forget was just the first step. He wanted to... to remake us."

Agent Kim had found a waterproof container tucked into a natural shelf. His face went pale as he scanned the contents. "Names and dates. Every single one." He looked up at Maya. "You're on here. August 1998. 'Subject showed exceptional resistance. Recommend extended protocol.'"

Maya took the paper with numb fingers. There was her name, reduced to clinical notes. And below it, Sarah's. And below that...

"Tommy Morrison," she read aloud. "June 1998. 'Subject witnessed primary integration. Termination required.'"

"Maya, we've got 23 names on this list," Agent Martinez said grimly. "Every single missing child. He documented everything."

At the bottom of the container was a laminated map. Maya's blood turned to ice as she recognized her own sleep-drawn tunnels, but with additions. Labels in Dr. Richard's precise handwriting: "Preparation Chamber," "Memory Dissolution Tank," and at the deepest point, circled in red: "Integration Suite."

"We need to go deeper," Maya said, though every instinct screamed at her to run. "That's where... that's where he took them."

The team exchanged glances. The cave specialists checked their equipment one more time.

"Stay close," Agent Martinez ordered. "And Maya? The moment this becomes too much, you tell me. These children need justice, but not at the cost of your life."

Maya nodded, not trusting her voice. As they prepared to descend deeper into the hollow shore, she heard it—faint but unmistakable. The sound from her nightmares, from her suppressed memories, from all the missing children's stories.

Somewhere in the darkness below, voices were singing.
