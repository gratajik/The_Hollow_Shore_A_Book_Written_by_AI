# Chapter 5: Hidden Passages

The voices from downstairs drifted up through the old house like smoke, muffled but unmistakably urgent. Maya pressed her ear to the floor, trying to make out the words, but could only catch fragments—"permanent solution," "too dangerous," "no choice now."

She sat back on her heels, heart hammering. The dresser she'd dragged against the door wouldn't hold them for long if they decided to force their way in. And the footsteps in the walls had stopped, which somehow felt worse than hearing them.

Maya stood and moved to the window, testing the old latch. Three stories up, with nothing but rocks below. Even if she could climb down, where would she go? The island was small, isolated, and they knew every inch of it.

A soft scraping sound made her freeze. Not from the hallway—from behind her.

She turned slowly to see the wardrobe shifting slightly, as if something was pushing against it from the other side. Maya grabbed the brass letter opener from the desk and approached carefully. The scraping came again, and she realized there was a gap between the wardrobe and the wall that hadn't been there before.

Or maybe it had been, and she just hadn't noticed.

Maya wedged her fingers into the gap and pulled. The wardrobe swung away from the wall on hidden hinges, revealing a narrow opening just wide enough for a person to squeeze through. A hidden passage, dark and musty with the smell of decades.

She stared into the darkness, understanding flooding through her. They'd been watching her. All along, through these passages, they'd been watching.

But if she could get in, she could get out. And more importantly, she could hear what they were really planning.

Maya squeezed through the opening, letter opener clutched in her hand. The passage was narrow, lined with rough wooden planks that caught at her clothes. Thin shafts of light filtered through gaps in the walls—peepholes, she realized. This whole house was riddled with them.

She moved carefully, testing each step before putting her full weight down. The passage seemed to follow the main hallway, with branches leading off in different directions. Victorian mansions often had servant corridors, she knew, but this felt different. More deliberate. More sinister.

A voice stopped her cold. Dr. Richard, clear as if he were standing next to her.

"—can't let her leave the island. She knows too much now."

Maya found the source—a larger peephole that looked down into the library. She could see the three of them gathered around the desk: Dr. Richard calm and controlled, Eleanor rigid with barely contained panic, and James pacing like a caged animal.

"This is insane," James was saying, his voice high with strain. "We can't just... we can't kill her, Richard. She's an innocent person."

"Innocent?" Dr. Richard's laugh was cold. "She's a threat to everything we've built. Everything this family represents. Just like Sarah was becoming a threat."

Eleanor's hands were shaking as she poured herself a drink. "The police will ask questions. That detective she spoke to—"

"Will be told that Maya had a psychological breakdown. That she became delusional, paranoid. Tragic, really, but these things happen to people with suppressed trauma." Dr. Richard's voice was clinical, detached. "We'll say she threw herself from the cliffs. Suicide, brought on by the stress of recovered memories."

Maya's blood turned to ice. They were planning to kill her and make it look like suicide. Just like they'd done to Sarah.

"She's just a child," James whispered, and Maya realized he wasn't talking about her. "Sarah was just a child when it started. They all were."

"Sentiment is a luxury we can't afford, James." Dr. Richard moved to the window, looking out at the gray morning. "This family has survived for generations by making difficult decisions. Maya is a problem that needs to be solved."

"Like Tommy Morrison was a problem?" The words came out before Maya could stop them, but they weren't her words. They were the words of an eight-year-old girl who had hidden in these same passages twenty-five years ago.

The memory hit her like a physical blow. She was eight years old again, crammed into this narrow space with Sarah, both of them trembling as they watched Dr. Richard through the peephole. But it wasn't the library they were watching—it was the basement. And Dr. Richard wasn't alone.

*"Please, Dr. Blackwood, I won't tell anyone. I promise I won't tell."*

*Tommy Morrison, ten years old, visiting the island with his family. Tommy who had seen too much, who had threatened to tell his parents about the "games" Dr. Richard liked to play.*

*"I know you won't tell, Tommy. I'm going to make sure of that."*

Maya pressed her hand to her mouth, fighting back a sob. She remembered now. All of it. The sound Tommy made when Dr. Richard's hands closed around his throat. The way his body went limp. The sheet Dr. Richard wrapped him in, carrying him out to the boat like a bundle of laundry.

And she remembered the promise she and Sarah had made, huddled together in the dark: never to tell. Never to speak of what they'd seen.

Dr. Richard had made sure of that promise with his "therapy sessions." Memory suppression, he'd called it. For their own good.

But Sarah's memories had started coming back. That's why she'd been so agitated in her final weeks, why she'd been trying to tell James about the other children. And when Dr. Richard realized the suppression was failing...

"Maya?"

She spun around, letter opener raised, to find James standing in the passage behind her. His face was pale, his eyes wide with something that might have been recognition.

"How did you—"

"I followed you. I saw the wardrobe move." He looked around the narrow space, confusion and dawning horror on his face. "I used to play in these passages when I was little. I'd forgotten... God, I'd forgotten so much."

Maya studied his face, seeing the same lost look she'd seen in the mirror after her own memories started returning. "What did you forget, James?"

"The other children. There were always other children visiting, and then... they'd leave suddenly. Their families would say they'd gotten sick, or there'd been an accident." His voice was barely a whisper. "But I remember now. Some of them never left at all."

From below, Dr. Richard's voice continued, cold and clinical. "We'll need to move quickly. Eleanor, you'll call the police in the morning, report that Maya never came down for breakfast. We'll say we found her room empty, assume she went for a walk and... well, these cliffs can be treacherous."

"What about the detective she called?" Eleanor's voice was strained.

"I'll handle Detective Park. A few words about Maya's unstable mental state, her history of psychological issues. These investigators, they see what they expect to see."

Maya felt James stiffen beside her. "History of psychological issues?"

"The memory suppression therapy," Maya whispered. "He's been documenting it all along, creating a paper trail to make me look unstable."

James's face went white. "Just like he did with Sarah. Her medical records, all those sessions about her 'delusions' and 'false memories.'" He looked at Maya with growing horror. "My God, what have we done? What have I been part of?"

"You didn't know," Maya said, though she wasn't sure she believed it. "You were a child too."

"I should have known. Sarah tried to tell me, and I... I let him drug her into silence." James's hands were shaking. "She was my daughter, and I let him—"

A sound from the passage ahead cut him off. Footsteps, moving with purpose. Dr. Richard's voice, closer now: "She's in the walls. I should have known she'd remember the passages."

Maya grabbed James's arm. "We need to move. Now."

They crept through the narrow corridors, Maya leading the way by instinct and recovered memory. The passages were a maze, connecting every room in the house, but she remembered the layout now. Remembered hiding here as a child, watching the adults through the peepholes, never understanding what she was seeing.

Behind them, she could hear Dr. Richard moving through the passages with the confidence of someone who knew them well. Of course he did. He'd been using them for decades, watching his victims, planning his moves.

"This way," Maya whispered, leading James toward a passage that sloped downward. "There's another room in the basement. A hidden room."

"How do you know?"

"Because that's where he took them. That's where he took Tommy."

The passage opened into a small chamber behind the basement wall. Maya had never seen this room as a child—she and Sarah had only watched from the passages—but she knew it was here. Could feel it like a wound in the house's foundation.

She found the hidden door and pushed it open.

The room beyond was small and windowless, lit by a single bare bulb. Medical equipment lined the walls—not the antique pieces from Dr. Richard's office, but modern instruments. Restraints. Syringes. And in the corner, a small bed with rumpled sheets.

"Jesus Christ," James breathed.

Maya stepped into the room, her investigator's mind cataloging the evidence even as her heart broke. This wasn't just a room where Dr. Richard had committed crimes twenty-five years ago. This was active. Current.

"He's still doing it," she whispered. "He never stopped."

A soft sound from the bed made them both freeze. Maya approached carefully and pulled back the sheet.

A child lay there, maybe ten years old, unconscious but breathing. A boy with dark hair and pale skin, an IV line running into his arm.

"Oh God," James said. "Oh God, who is he?"

Maya checked the boy's pulse—steady but slow. Sedated. She looked at the IV bag and felt sick. "He's drugged. How long has he been here?"

"I don't know. I swear to God, Maya, I didn't know about this room. I didn't know he was still—"

"Well, well. I was wondering when you'd find this place."

They spun around to see Dr. Richard standing in the doorway, medical bag in hand. Eleanor was behind him, her face a mask of aristocratic composure that couldn't quite hide the desperation in her eyes.

"Step away from the boy, Maya. He's very sick, and you're not qualified to treat him."

"Sick?" Maya's voice was deadly quiet. "Or drugged into compliance?"

Dr. Richard smiled that cold, clinical smile. "Sometimes the two are the same thing. The mind can be a very dangerous place, especially for children who've experienced trauma. I'm helping him forget things that would destroy his life."

"Like you helped me forget? Like you helped Sarah?"

"I tried to help Sarah. But she was resistant to treatment. Some patients are." He opened his medical bag, revealing rows of syringes. "You, on the other hand, were always a model patient. Until now."

James stepped forward, putting himself between Dr. Richard and Maya. "Uncle Richard, this has to stop. This is wrong. This is—"

"This is necessary." Dr. Richard's voice was sharp. "This family has protected its interests for generations, James. We don't let outsiders threaten what we've built."

"By murdering children?"

"By solving problems before they become crises." Dr. Richard pulled out a syringe, checking the dosage with professional precision. "Maya, you're going to come with me quietly. We're going to walk to the cliffs, and you're going to have a tragic accident. Or we can do this the hard way, and I'll sedate you first. Your choice."

Maya looked at the unconscious boy, at James's horrified face, at Eleanor's cold calculation. She thought about Sarah, about Tommy Morrison, about all the other children who had disappeared into Dr. Richard's "treatment."

She thought about the scared eight-year-old girl who had made a promise to keep terrible secrets.

And she made her choice.

"I've been running from y'all my whole life," she said, her Southern drawl emerging strong and clear. "Not anymore."

Maya's phone, forgotten in her pocket, suddenly buzzed with an incoming call. The signal had returned.

Dr. Richard's eyes flicked to the phone, then back to her face. His smile was gone now, replaced by something cold and calculating.

"Choose, Maya," he said softly. "Your life, or the child's. Because if you try to fight me, if you try to call for help, I'll make sure he never wakes up. And there will be other children after him. There always are."

Maya looked at the boy, at the IV line that could deliver death as easily as sedation. She looked at James, who was staring at his uncle with dawning horror. She looked at Eleanor, who had chosen family reputation over human lives for so long that she'd forgotten the difference.

And she made her decision.

"No," she said simply. "No more."

The phone kept ringing.
