# Chapter 9: The Pattern Emerges

Maya's apartment had become a makeshift command center for grief. Three computer monitors displayed video call windows, each showing a different family's pain etched in pixels and sorrow. She'd been at this for six hours straight, and the weight of their collective loss pressed against her chest like a physical thing.

"Emma loved to draw," Mrs. Washington was saying, her voice thin with years of unanswered questions. "She'd fill sketchbooks with these elaborate underwater scenes. After the therapy with Dr. Blackwood, she started drawing the same thing over and over—children sleeping in dark places. She called it 'the hollow shore.'"

Maya's hand stilled over her notepad. "The hollow shore? Did she say anything else about it?"

Mr. Washington leaned into frame, his face haggard. "She said she could hear children singing there. We thought it was just her imagination acting up again. Dr. Blackwood assured us the drawings were part of her processing her behavioral issues."

"When did she disappear?" Maya asked gently.

"Three weeks after her last session. She left a note that just said 'I have to find the shore.' The police found her backpack by the harbor, but..." Mrs. Washington's voice broke.

"But no body," Maya finished. It was becoming a horrifying refrain.

After ending the call with promises to keep them informed, Maya immediately connected with the Chen family in New Hampshire. No relation to her, despite the shared surname, but their son Lucas had vanished eight years ago under similar circumstances.

"He was such a bright boy," Mr. Chen said, his English accented but precise. "Too bright, maybe. He witnessed a car accident that killed his best friend. The trauma made him act out, so we took him to Dr. Blackwood. He came highly recommended."

"What happened after the therapy?" Maya asked, though she could already predict the answer.

"Lucas became quiet. Withdrawn. He kept asking about underground places, said he could hear other children calling him. We thought it was PTSD from the accident, but Dr. Blackwood said it was normal, part of the healing process."

Mrs. Chen added, "The night he disappeared, he told us he remembered something important about a shore. A hollow shore where children were waiting. We woke up and he was gone."

The pattern was crystallizing with each family's story. Maya's final call of the day was with the Rodriguez family in Rhode Island. Their daughter Sofia had vanished eighteen years ago—one of Dr. Blackwood's earlier victims.

"Sofia witnessed her uncle's death in a boating accident," Mrs. Rodriguez explained, her grief still fresh after nearly two decades. "She was only nine. Dr. Blackwood said he specialized in childhood trauma, that he could help her process what she'd seen."

"But instead she got worse?" Maya prompted.

"Different," Mr. Rodriguez corrected. "She became obsessed with the idea that her uncle was waiting for her somewhere. She kept talking about a hollow shore where lost children go. Dr. Blackwood said it was a coping mechanism, that she was creating a fantasy to deal with the loss."

"Did she mention anything about underground spaces? Other children?"

Mrs. Rodriguez's eyes widened. "Yes! She said she could hear them singing underground. How did you know?"

Maya's throat tightened. "It's part of a pattern we're seeing. I'm so sorry for what you've been through."

After ending the calls, Maya sat in her darkened apartment, surrounded by notes and photographs of missing children. Twenty-three families, twenty-three variations on the same horrific theme. Children who'd witnessed trauma, sent to Dr. Blackwood for help, only to disappear after developing obsessions with underground spaces and something called the hollow shore.

Her phone buzzed. Agent Martinez.

"Can you come to the office?" the agent asked. "Patricia Valdez is here with some concerning information about your original commission."

An hour later, Maya sat in the FBI conference room as Patricia Valdez spread documents across the table.

"I've been reviewing the paperwork from your hiring," Patricia said. "Something's been bothering me about it. Look at this signature."

Maya studied Eleanor Blackwood's supposed signature on her commission documents. "What about it?"

Agent Kim pulled up another document on his laptop. "This is Eleanor Blackwood's actual signature from legal documents filed last year. Notice the difference?"

Maya compared them. The signatures were similar but not identical—the kind of careful forgery that would fool a casual glance but not serious scrutiny.

"Someone impersonated Eleanor to hire me," Maya said slowly. "But who? And why?"

"That's what we need to figure out," Agent Martinez said. "Whoever did this went to elaborate lengths to get you specifically. They knew exactly what buttons to push. The question is why."

Patricia handed Maya another document. "Look at the language in your commission letter. Notice anything unusual?"

Maya read through it again, this time with fresh eyes. Certain phrases jumped out: "investigate the truth hidden beneath family secrets," "uncover what was buried long ago," "justice for the innocent lost to time."

"These aren't phrases Eleanor Blackwood would use," Maya realized. "They're too... personal. Too specific."

"Exactly," Patricia said. "Whoever wrote this knew you'd respond to these particular triggers. They knew your background, your psychology."

Maya felt a chill run down her spine. "They knew I'd take this case."

Back in her apartment that night, Maya pulled out boxes she hadn't opened in years. Old files, photographs, documents from her childhood. If someone had manipulated her into taking this case, there had to be a reason. Something in her past that connected her to the Blackwood family.

She found her childhood medical records, noting a gap between ages seven and nine. The records picked up again with notations about "successful therapeutic intervention" and "childhood anxiety resolved." But there were no details about what the therapy was for or who had provided it.

Her hands trembled as she picked up her phone. She hadn't called her mother in months, their relationship strained by years of distance and unspoken tensions.

"Maya?" Her mother's voice was surprised. "Is everything alright?"

"Mom, I need to ask you about something. When I was eight, I had therapy. Do you remember who the doctor was?"

The silence stretched too long. "Why are you asking about this now? That was so long ago, Maya. Some things are better left buried."

"Mom, please. It's important."

"I don't... we agreed not to talk about that time. You were having such terrible nightmares, and the therapy helped. That's all that matters."

"What was I having nightmares about?"

"I have to go," her mother said quickly. "Your father's calling me."

The line went dead. Maya stared at the phone, her mother's evasiveness confirming her suspicions. There was something about her childhood therapy that her parents didn't want her to know.

She turned back to the boxes and found a small photo album she didn't remember keeping. As she flipped through it, one picture made her freeze. It showed her as a child, maybe eight years old, standing on a beach with another young girl. The blonde girl had her arm around Maya's shoulders, both of them grinning at the camera.

The blonde girl looked exactly like a young Sarah Blackwood.

Maya's hands shook as she turned the photo over. Written in a child's careful handwriting: "Me and Sarah at the hollow shore, summer 1998."

The hollow shore. The same phrase the missing children had mentioned. The same place that haunted their final days.

Her phone rang, startling her. Dr. Sarah Chen's name appeared on the screen.

"I'm sorry to call so late," Maya said, "but I need to talk to someone."

"That's what I'm here for," Dr. Chen assured her. "What's happening?"

Maya explained about the forged signature, the manipulated hiring, and the photograph. "I'm not just investigating this case, am I? I'm part of it. Someone knows that, and they've been playing me from the start."

"How does that make you feel?"

"Angry," Maya admitted. "Scared. But also... determined. Whoever did this wanted me to find the truth. Maybe they couldn't do it themselves, but they knew I could."

"That's a very empowering way to frame it," Dr. Chen said. "You're choosing to see yourself as having agency rather than being merely a pawn."

"I was manipulated into taking this case, but I'm choosing to continue it," Maya said firmly. "These families deserve answers. Those children deserve justice. And I need to know what happened to me, what connects me to Sarah Blackwood and the hollow shore."

"Just remember," Dr. Chen cautioned, "recovering suppressed memories can be traumatic. You don't have to do this alone."

After the call, Maya sat in her living room, surrounded by evidence of a conspiracy that spanned decades. Someone had orchestrated her involvement in this case, someone who knew about her suppressed memories and her connection to Sarah Blackwood.

She picked up the photograph again, studying her younger self's carefree smile. Somewhere in her mind, behind walls built by therapy and time, lay the truth about what had happened that summer. The truth about the hollow shore and why children who mentioned it disappeared.

Tomorrow, she would return to the FBI office and share what she'd discovered. She would continue working with the victim families, following the pattern that Dr. Richard Blackwood had woven through decades of abuse. But now she understood that she wasn't just an investigator looking in from the outside.

She was a survivor, searching for her own stolen memories. And someone out there was counting on her to find them.

Maya looked out her window at the Boston skyline, lights twinkling in the darkness. Somewhere out there, the person who had manipulated her into this case was waiting. They had set her on this path for a reason, knowing that eventually, she would have to confront her own past to solve the mystery of the present.

"Alright," she whispered to the night. "You wanted me to find the truth? I will. All of it."

The pattern had emerged, revealing a web of connections that stretched back to her own childhood. Act One of her investigation was ending, but Act Two—the journey into her own suppressed memories—was about to begin.

And Maya Chen was ready to face whatever truths lay buried at the hollow shore.
