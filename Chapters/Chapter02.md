# Chapter 2: The House of Secrets

The ferry horn's final blast still echoed in Maya's ears as she stood in the Blackwood mansion's entrance hall, watching Eleanor's face shift from shock to something harder, more calculating. The older woman's fingers tightened on the commission letter until the paper crinkled.

"Someone," Eleanor said, each word precise as a scalpel cut, "has gone to extraordinary lengths to bring you here, Ms. Chen. The question is not just who, but why. What could they hope to accomplish?"

James shifted beside his mother, that nervous energy Maya had noticed at the dock now radiating from him like heat from a fever. "Mother, perhaps we should—"

"We should understand exactly what's happening." Eleanor's gaze never left Maya's face. "Someone forged my signature, used my personal stationery, and paid you—how much was it?"

"Twenty-five thousand dollars as a retainer." Maya kept her voice steady, professional. The investigator in her was already cataloging details: the way James's hands trembled slightly, how Eleanor's perfect composure couldn't quite hide the fury beneath. "With another twenty-five upon completion."

"Fifty thousand dollars." Eleanor's laugh was sharp as winter ice. "Someone wants you here very badly indeed."

Through the tall windows, Maya could see the October sky darkening, clouds piling up like accusations. The wind had picked up since her arrival, rattling the old glass in its frames. She thought of Captain Murphy's ferry, already halfway back to the mainland, and pushed down the flutter of unease in her chest.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Maya said, letting her professional instincts take over, "I'm here now, and I'm good at what I do. Why don't we use this opportunity? Let me look into Sarah's death. If it was suicide, I'll confirm it. If not..." She let the implication hang in the air like mist.

Eleanor studied her for a long moment. Behind her, the grandfather clock in the corner ticked steadily, marking time like a metronome. Finally, she nodded once, sharply.

"Very well. Though I warn you, Ms. Chen, you may not like what you find. This family—" She paused, seeming to reconsider her words. "This family has endured enough tragedy."

The front door burst open, bringing with it a gust of cold air that smelled of rain and pine. A tall man strode in, shaking droplets from his silver hair. He moved with the confidence of someone used to taking charge of situations, and Maya felt the atmosphere in the room shift immediately.

"Well, well." His voice carried a trace of Chicago in its directness, a no-nonsense tone that cut through the mansion's Gothic atmosphere. "Eleanor didn't mention we were expecting company. I'm Dr. Richard Blackwood. And you are...?"

He extended his hand, and Maya noticed how his eyes—sharp, intelligent, the same gray as the gathering storm—assessed her with clinical precision. She recognized the look. She'd seen it in enough medical professionals during investigations, but there was something else there too. Something that made her want to take a step back.

"Maya Chen. Private investigator." She shook his hand briefly, noting the firm grip, the way he held on just a fraction too long.

"An investigator?" His eyebrows rose, and he turned to Eleanor. "Has something happened?"

"Someone has hired Ms. Chen to look into Sarah's death." Eleanor's voice was carefully neutral. "Using my name and stationery."

Dr. Richard's expression didn't change, but Maya caught the quick glance he shot at James, the way the younger man seemed to shrink slightly under his uncle's gaze.

"How... interesting." He turned back to Maya, and this time his smile was warmer, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. "You seem familiar, Ms. Chen. Have we met?"

The question sent an unexpected chill down Maya's spine. *Lord have mercy*, she thought, then caught herself. The South had been creeping back into her thoughts all day, and now this man's direct stare was making it worse.

"I don't believe so," she said, keeping her voice level.

"Hmm." He studied her a moment longer, then clapped his hands together. "Well, let's not stand here in the hallway. Eleanor, shall we adjourn to the parlor? I think we need to discuss this... situation."

The parlor was exactly what Maya expected from a Victorian mansion—heavy furniture, dark wood, portraits of stern-faced ancestors glaring down from the walls. But it was the family dynamics that held her attention as they arranged themselves in the room. Eleanor took the wingback chair by the fireplace like a queen claiming her throne. Dr. Richard stood behind her, one hand resting on the chair back in a gesture that looked protective but felt more like possession. James perched on the edge of a sofa, his leg bouncing with nervous energy.

"So," Dr. Richard said, his Chicago bluntness emerging, "let's cut to the chase here. Who would want to hire a private investigator to look into Sarah's death? And why impersonate Eleanor to do it?"

"That's what I intend to find out," Maya said. She pulled out her notebook, a deliberate gesture to establish her professional presence. "Perhaps we could start with Sarah's state of mind in the weeks before her death. I understand she'd been troubled?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. James's leg stilled.

"Sarah was..." Eleanor began, then paused, choosing her words carefully. "Sarah had struggled with mental health issues for years. Richard had been treating her."

"Depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation." Dr. Richard rattled off the diagnoses with clinical detachment. "I'd been her physician since she was a child. These conditions often worsen in early adulthood."

"She wasn't paranoid!" The words burst from James like water through a dam. His New York accent thickened with emotion, words tumbling over each other. "She was scared. She kept saying she remembered things, things from when we were children that couldn't possibly—"

Eleanor's sharp look cut him off mid-sentence. The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken warnings.

"What James means," Dr. Richard said smoothly, "is that Sarah had been experiencing false memories. It's not uncommon in certain conditions. The mind can play cruel tricks."

Maya made a note, her finger tapping against her pen. Something was off here, some undercurrent she couldn't quite identify. "I'd like to see her room, if that's possible. Sometimes personal effects can provide insight into a person's state of mind."

Eleanor's jaw tightened. "Her room has been left exactly as it was. I'm not sure—"

"I'll show her." James stood abruptly. "I mean, if that's all right, Mother."

Eleanor and Dr. Richard exchanged a look Maya couldn't read. Finally, Eleanor nodded. "Very well. But James, remember that Ms. Chen is here under... unusual circumstances. We don't know who sent her or why."

"I understand your concern," Maya said, standing as well. "I appreciate y'all's hospitality, given the situation." The Southern phrase slipped out before she could stop it, and she saw Dr. Richard's eyes sharpen with interest.

"Southern accent," he observed. "Where are you from originally, Ms. Chen?"

"Columbia, South Carolina." She kept her tone light, but her defensive instincts were stirring. "Though I've been in Boston for fifteen years now."

"Interesting. And what brought you from psychology to private investigation? You did study psychology, didn't you?"

Maya went very still. She hadn't mentioned her educational background. "How did you—"

"Just a guess." His smile was disarming. "You have the observational skills of someone trained in human behavior. Am I wrong?"

She didn't answer, just held his gaze until James cleared his throat. "Should we... the room?"

"Yes." Maya turned away from Dr. Richard's knowing smile. "Lead the way."

Sarah's room was on the second floor, at the end of a long hallway lined with more family portraits. Maya followed James, hyperaware of the way the old floorboards creaked under their feet, the musty smell of age and secrets that seemed to permeate the walls. When James opened the door, she had to catch her breath.

The room was an explosion of color and life in the otherwise somber house. Canvases leaned against every wall, some finished, others abandoned mid-brushstroke. The desk was cluttered with art supplies, journals, photographs pinned to a corkboard in no discernible order. It was chaos, but it was vibrant chaos, the room of someone who felt things deeply.

"She was talented," Maya said softly.

"She was everything." James's voice cracked. "My whole world, really. After her mother died, it was just us for so long. Even after we moved back here, even with Mother and Uncle Richard, it was always Sarah and me against the world."

Maya moved into the room, and that's when it hit her—a wave of déjà vu so strong she had to grip the doorframe. The smell of oil paints mixed with something else, something floral and familiar. Her hand found the edge of the desk, and suddenly she could see another hand there, smaller, younger, reaching for—

"Ms. Chen?"

She blinked, and the vision faded. James was looking at her with concern.

"I'm fine. Just... the paint fumes." She forced herself to focus, to be the investigator rather than whatever else was stirring inside her. "May I look around?"

"Of course."

She moved methodically through the room, noting the medications on the nightstand (all prescribed by Dr. Richard), the stack of psychology textbooks that seemed at odds with the family's narrative of Sarah's mental state. On the desk, half-hidden under a sketch pad, she found what looked like therapy notes in Sarah's handwriting:

*Dr. Torres says recovered memories can feel more real than regular memories. The body remembers even when the mind forgets. Why do I keep dreaming about the blue room?*

"Who's Dr. Torres?" Maya asked.

James glanced toward the door nervously. "A therapist Sarah started seeing on the mainland. Without telling the family. Uncle Richard was... not pleased when he found out."

"I imagine not." Maya carefully moved the sketch pad aside, revealing more notes. Her heart rate picked up as she read Sarah's increasingly frantic handwriting:

*Maya knows. She was there. We promised never to tell, but what if we were wrong? What if silence is what he wants?*

Maya. Her own name stared up at her from the page, and the room seemed to tilt. She quickly pocketed the pages while James was looking out the window at the gathering storm.

"We should go back down," he said. "Uncle Richard doesn't like people in Sarah's room. He says it's not good for Mother's grieving process."

"Of course." Maya's mind was racing, but she kept her expression neutral. "Just one more question—did Sarah ever mention anyone named Maya?"

James turned from the window, and for a moment, something flickered in his eyes. "Maya? No, I don't... why?"

Before she could answer, the lights flickered. Thunder rumbled overhead, close enough to rattle the windows.

"Storm's here," James said unnecessarily. His nervous energy was back, crackling like electricity. "We should—this is just like when Sarah—" He cut himself off, pressing his lips together.

"Like when Sarah what?"

But he was already heading for the door. "We need to get back. Uncle Richard will be wondering where we are."

They found the family in the library, a room that seemed designed to intimidate with its floor-to-ceiling shelves and leather-bound volumes that looked like they hadn't been touched in decades. Dr. Richard was pouring drinks from a crystal decanter while Eleanor sat rigidly in another wingback chair. Through the tall windows, Maya could see the rain had started, lashing against the glass with increasing fury.

"Ah, there you are." Dr. Richard held up the decanter. "Whiskey, Ms. Chen? You look like you could use it."

"No, thank you." She needed her wits about her, especially now.

"Find anything interesting in Sarah's room?" His tone was casual, but those sharp eyes missed nothing.

"She was clearly a talented artist," Maya said carefully. "And she seemed to be doing a lot of reading about psychology."

"Self-diagnosis is a dangerous thing." He handed Eleanor a glass, then poured one for himself. "Sarah became obsessed with the idea that her problems stemmed from repressed trauma rather than accepting the reality of her condition."

"And what condition was that, exactly?"

"Bipolar disorder with psychotic features." The medical terms rolled off his tongue with practiced ease. "Though she refused to accept the diagnosis. Preferred to believe in recovered memories and past trauma. Dr. Torres encouraged these delusions, I'm afraid."

The lights flickered again, and this time they stayed off for several seconds before coming back on. In the darkness, Maya could have sworn she heard something—a child's laughter, distant and echoing. But that was impossible.

"The generator will kick in if we lose power," Eleanor said, though she looked less certain than her words suggested. "It's happened before during storms."

A knock at the library door made them all turn. Margaret Swift, the groundskeeper, stood in the doorway, rain dripping from her coat.

"Sorry to interrupt, but I've just had word from the harbor. Ferry service is suspended until the storm passes. Could be tomorrow, could be the day after. This one's looking like a real nor'easter."

Maya felt the walls of the house press closer. She was trapped now, truly trapped, with a family that was lying about something and her own name in a dead woman's journal.

"Well then," Dr. Richard said, raising his glass with a smile that didn't reach his eyes, "I suppose you're our guest for the duration, Ms. Chen. How fortunate that someone paid for you to have an extended stay."

Thunder crashed overhead, and the lights went out again. In the darkness, Maya heard James whisper, "Just like when Sarah died. The storm came then too."

When the lights flickered back on, Dr. Richard was standing much closer to Maya than he had been before.

"Memory is such a fragile thing, isn't it?" he said softly. "So easily influenced by stress, by environment. You must be very tired after your journey. Perhaps you should rest."

"I'm fine," Maya said, but even as the words left her mouth, she felt a strange heaviness in her limbs. The paint fumes from Sarah's room, the stress of the day, the strange familiarity of everything—it was all catching up to her.

"Margaret will show you to your room," Eleanor said, rising from her chair with regal grace. "We keep the blue guest room ready for visitors."

*The blue room.*

The words from Sarah's journal echoed in Maya's mind, and she felt that tilting sensation again, as if the floor wasn't quite where it should be.

"That's very kind," she managed.

As Margaret led her from the library, Maya caught a glimpse of the family reflected in the dark window—Eleanor seated again, James hunched on the sofa, and Dr. Richard standing between them like a guardian. Or a jailer.

The guest room was at the far end of the second floor, past Sarah's room, past doors that seemed familiar even though they shouldn't be. The wallpaper was a faded blue pattern that might have been cheerful once but now looked like water stains, like drowning. Margaret set Maya's overnight bag on the bed and turned to leave.

"Dinner's at seven," she said. "Though with the storm, might be cold sandwiches if we lose power again."

"Thank you."

Margaret paused at the door. "You know, Sarah used to say this room gave her nightmares. Said she could hear things in the walls. But then, poor girl said a lot of things toward the end."

She left before Maya could respond, closing the door with a soft click that sounded unnaturally loud.

Maya sat on the bed, pulling out the pages she'd taken from Sarah's room. Her hands were shaking slightly as she read them again. *Maya knows. She was there.*

But she didn't know. She'd never been here before. She was sure of it.

Wasn't she?

She stood, needing to move, to think. The room felt too small, the blue wallpaper too close. She reached for the doorknob, and the moment her hand touched the cold brass, the world exploded into memory.

*She was eight years old, her hand barely able to grip the same doorknob. Sarah was beside her, also eight, blonde hair in pigtails.*

*"We can't tell," Sarah whispered, her voice high with fear. "We can't ever tell or something bad will happen."*

*From somewhere below came the sound of screaming—a child's voice, terrified and in pain. Then silence. Then Dr. Richard's voice, calm and controlled: "There's been an accident. Everyone needs to remain calm."*

*But Maya had seen. Through the crack in the door, she'd seen the blue room, seen what was on the floor, seen Dr. Richard's hands—*

"Ms. Chen? Are you feeling well?"

Maya gasped, jerking back to the present. Dr. Richard stood in the hallway, having appeared as silently as a ghost. His expression was concerned, professional, but there was something else in his eyes. Something that might have been recognition.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," he said softly.

Maya's hand was still on the doorknob, her knuckles white from gripping it. She forced herself to let go, to step back.

"I'm fine," she said, but her voice sounded strange to her own ears. "Just tired, like you said."

"Of course." He didn't move from the doorway. "These old houses can be unsettling during storms. All those creaks and groans. Sometimes people think they hear things. See things. Especially if they're already under stress."

"I said I'm fine."

"I'm sure you are." His smile was gentle, understanding. The kind of smile doctors gave to patients who needed to be handled carefully. "But if you need anything—something to help you sleep, perhaps—I'm just down the hall. Third door on the right. I always travel with my medical bag."

He finally stepped back, allowing her to close the door. She turned the lock, then leaned against the wood, her heart hammering.

She'd been here before. As a child. With Sarah. And something terrible had happened, something that Dr. Richard had covered up. Something that Sarah had started to remember.

Something that had gotten her killed.

Outside, the storm raged against the windows, and somewhere in the house, she could hear footsteps pacing back and forth, back and forth, like someone trying to walk away from a memory that wouldn't let them go.

Maya pressed her hand to her chest, feeling the rapid beat of her heart, and wondered if she'd been brought here to investigate a murder, or to remember one.
