# Chapter 4: Morning Confrontations

Maya woke before dawn, her body rigid with tension despite having slept only in fragments. The memory from the night before played on repeat—eight-year-old Maya and Sarah hiding in the basement, Dr. Richard carrying something wrapped in a sheet, the promise never to tell. But some promises, she'd realized in the dark hours before morning, were meant to be broken.

She sat up carefully, listening to the house around her. The storm had passed, leaving behind an eerie quiet broken only by the distant sound of waves and the occasional creak of old wood settling. Through her window, she could see debris scattered across the grounds—broken branches, scattered roof tiles, evidence of the night's violence.

Maya pulled out her phone and scrolled through the photos she'd taken in the basement. The evidence was all there: her own medical file documenting memory suppression therapy, the childhood photographs proving her presence on the island, dozens of files on other children who had visited over the years. Some marked "deceased."

Her hands were steady now, her mind clear. The confused, vulnerable woman who'd arrived on this island two days ago was gone. In her place was the investigator she'd trained to be, armed with evidence and a growing understanding of exactly what she was up against.

She needed a strategy. Appear cooperative while gathering more evidence. Keep the family talking while documenting their contradictions. And most importantly, find a way to contact the outside world.

Maya dressed carefully in her most professional clothes—dark slacks, crisp white shirt, blazer. Armor for the psychological warfare ahead. She hid the printed photos inside her jacket and slipped her phone into an inner pocket where it couldn't be easily taken.

The dining room felt different in the morning light. The family portraits that had seemed merely imposing yesterday now felt like judges presiding over decades of secrets. Eleanor sat at the head of the table, her silver hair perfectly arranged despite the chaos of the storm. James fidgeted with his coffee cup, dark circles under his eyes suggesting he'd slept as poorly as Maya. And Dr. Richard...

Dr. Richard watched her with those sharp gray eyes, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. His medical bag sat on the sideboard behind him, black leather gleaming like a threat.

"Good morning, Maya," he said, his voice warm with false concern. "I hope you slept better than you looked when I checked on you last night. You seemed quite... distressed."

Maya kept her expression neutral as she took her seat. "I'm fine, thank you. Just tired from the journey."

"Hmm." Dr. Richard cut into his eggs with surgical precision. "I have to say, I'm concerned about your mental state. Last night's episode suggests you might be experiencing some kind of psychological break. The stress of this investigation, combined with being in an unfamiliar place..."

"What episode?" Maya asked quietly.

"You don't remember?" His eyebrows rose in mock surprise. "You were quite agitated when I found you in the hallway. Talking about seeing things, remembering things that couldn't possibly have happened. Classic symptoms of acute stress reaction."

Eleanor dabbed at her lips with a linen napkin. "Richard has extensive experience with these matters, Ms. Chen. Perhaps you should listen to his advice."

"I appreciate Dr. Blackwood's concern," Maya said carefully, "but I'm perfectly fine. Just adjusting to the... atmosphere of the house."

James's fork clattered against his plate. "She was trying to tell me something," he said suddenly, his voice high with strain. "Sarah, I mean. In her last weeks, she kept saying she remembered things from when she was little. About the other children who used to visit. But Mother said it was impossible because she was too young to remember, and Richard said it was just the medication making her confused, but what if—"

"James." Eleanor's voice was sharp as a blade. "We've discussed this."

"But what if she was right? What if there really was an accident, and we just—"

"James." Dr. Richard's voice was gentler but somehow more threatening. "You know how these conversations upset you. Perhaps you should take your morning medication."

Maya watched the exchange with professional interest, noting how quickly James was silenced, how Eleanor and Dr. Richard worked in perfect coordination. "What accident?" she asked.

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

"A childhood incident," Eleanor said carefully. "Years ago. Nothing that concerns your investigation."

"If it affected Sarah's mental state before her death, it concerns me very much." Maya leaned forward slightly. "Dr. Blackwood, as Sarah's physician, surely you have records of her treatment? I'd like to review them."

Dr. Richard's smile never wavered, but something cold flickered in his eyes. "I'm afraid patient confidentiality prevents me from sharing those records. Even with family permission."

"I'm not family. I'm a licensed investigator hired to determine the circumstances of Sarah's death. Medical records relevant to her mental state would be crucial evidence."

"Evidence of what, exactly?" Eleanor's voice was ice-cold. "Sarah took her own life. The police have already determined that."

"Actually, the police determined she drowned. The suicide ruling was... preliminary." Maya watched their faces carefully. "I've found evidence suggesting Sarah was murdered."

The silence that followed was deafening. James went pale, his hands shaking as he set down his coffee cup. Eleanor's mask of composure slipped for just a moment, revealing something that looked like fear. And Dr. Richard...

Dr. Richard leaned back in his chair, studying Maya with renewed interest. "That's a very serious accusation, Maya. Are you certain you're thinking clearly? Sometimes stress and isolation can cause people to see patterns that aren't really there, to construct elaborate theories from coincidental evidence."

"I'm thinking very clearly, Dr. Blackwood."

"Are you? Because I have to say, your behavior since arriving here has been... concerning. The confusion, the agitation, the claims about remembering things that never happened." He stood up, moving toward his medical bag. "I think you need help, Maya. Something to calm your nerves, help you think more rationally."

Maya stood as well, her hand moving instinctively toward her phone. "I don't need medication, Dr. Blackwood. What I need are answers."

"Sometimes the mind needs guidance to process difficult situations properly." He opened his medical bag, revealing rows of vials and syringes. "I have something that will help you sleep, help you think more clearly. It's for your own good."

"I'm not your patient."

"No, but you're clearly having a psychological episode. As a medical professional, I have a responsibility to help."

Maya backed toward the door. "Dr. Blackwood, I'm a licensed investigator, not your patient. If you're concerned about my mental state, I suggest you document your concerns through proper channels."

His mask slipped then, just for a moment, and Maya saw something predatory underneath the charming facade. "Maya, you're not thinking clearly. You're isolated, confused, constructing elaborate fantasies. Let me help you."

"The only help I need is a phone." Maya moved toward the hallway. "I need to contact Detective Park."

"The phone lines are down," Eleanor said quickly. "Storm damage."

"Then I'll use the radio. Or wait for the ferry."

"Ferry service is suspended indefinitely," Dr. Richard said, following her into the hallway. "You're not going anywhere, Maya. Not until we're certain you're... stable."

Maya felt her Southern drawl threatening to emerge and fought to keep it down. "Y'all seem mighty concerned about my mental state for people who barely know me."

"We're concerned because you're clearly unwell," Eleanor said, joining them in the hallway. "Making wild accusations, claiming to remember things that never happened. Richard, perhaps you should—"

"I remember plenty," Maya said quietly. "I remember being eight years old and hiding in the basement with Sarah. I remember hearing y'all argue about calling the police. I remember Dr. Richard carrying something wrapped in a sheet."

The silence was absolute.

James made a small, choked sound. Eleanor went white as paper. And Dr. Richard...

Dr. Richard smiled, but it was nothing like the charming expression he'd worn before. This smile was cold, calculating, and utterly without warmth.

"Well," he said softly. "That changes things, doesn't it?"

Maya turned and ran.

She made it to the library before Dr. Richard caught up with her, his medical bag in hand. The room was lined with books from floor to ceiling, heavy curtains blocking most of the morning light. Maya grabbed the phone from the desk, but the line was dead.

"I told you the phones were down," Dr. Richard said, closing the door behind him. "Maya, you're clearly having a psychological break. These false memories, this paranoid behavior—it's textbook acute stress reaction. I need to sedate you before you hurt yourself."

"Stay away from me." Maya backed toward the windows, her hand on her phone. Still no signal.

"I'm trying to help you. Just like I helped you before, when you were eight years old and traumatized by something you were too young to understand." He opened his medical bag, pulling out a syringe. "The memory suppression therapy was successful then. It can be successful again."

"You mean you can erase my memories again."

"I can help you forget things that are too painful to remember. Things that would destroy your life if you tried to process them." He moved closer, the syringe gleaming in the dim light. "You made a promise, Maya. You and Sarah both promised never to tell. I'm just helping you keep that promise."

"What happened to the other child? The one in the photograph who looked terrified?"

Dr. Richard's expression didn't change. "Accidents happen, Maya. Children can be... careless. Especially when they're playing in dangerous places."

"You killed him."

"I protected my family. Just like I'm protecting them now." He lunged forward with the syringe.

Maya dodged, grabbing a heavy brass bookend from a nearby shelf. "Don't come any closer!"

"Maya, you're being irrational. This will only take a moment, and then you'll feel much better. Much calmer."

"Like Sarah felt calmer? Is that why you killed her? Because she was remembering too much?"

"Sarah was sick. She was going to destroy everything—the family, the reputation we've built, the lives of innocent people. I couldn't let that happen."

Maya swung the bookend as he lunged again, catching him across the wrist. He dropped the syringe with a curse, and Maya ran for the door.

The hallway was empty, but she could hear voices from the dining room—Eleanor and James in heated conversation. Maya slipped toward the back of the house, looking for another phone, another way to contact the outside world.

She found a landline in the kitchen and dialed Detective Park's number with shaking fingers.

"Park."

"Detective, it's Maya Chen. I need help. The family—"

The line went dead. Maya looked up to see Dr. Richard standing in the doorway, holding the phone cord he'd just yanked from the wall.

"I'm afraid you're not going anywhere, Maya. And you're not talking to anyone." His wrist was bleeding where she'd hit him, but his voice was calm, controlled. "You're going to take your medication like a good patient, and then we're going to have a long talk about what you think you remember."

Maya ran again, this time toward the back stairs. She could hear him following, his footsteps steady and unhurried. He knew she had nowhere to go.

She made it to her room and slammed the door, turning the old-fashioned key in the lock. Her hands were shaking as she dragged the heavy dresser in front of the door. It wouldn't hold him for long, but it might buy her time to think.

Maya pulled out her phone and tried calling Detective Park again. No signal. She tried texting. Nothing. The storm had knocked out the cell towers, and Dr. Richard had cut the landlines. She was completely isolated.

From downstairs, she could hear voices—the family in conference. They were planning something.

Maya sat on the bed, trying to think. The basement files had shown a pattern of abuse going back decades. Multiple children who had visited the island, some of whom had never left. Dr. Richard had been covering up his crimes for twenty-five years, using his medical authority to silence victims and manipulate families.

And now she was trapped with him.

A sound from the walls made her freeze. Footsteps, but not from the hallway. From inside the walls themselves.

The hidden passages. Of course. Dr. Richard knew every secret way through this house. He could be watching her right now, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Maya grabbed the brass letter opener from the desk and moved to the center of the room, away from the walls. Her heart was pounding, but her mind was clear. She was no longer the confused, vulnerable woman who'd arrived on this island. She was a trained investigator with evidence of multiple crimes and the will to fight.

The footsteps in the walls were getting closer.

Maya Chen had made a promise as a child never to tell. But some promises, she thought as she gripped the letter opener, were meant to be broken.

The footsteps stopped just behind the wall near her bed.

Maya held her breath and waited.
