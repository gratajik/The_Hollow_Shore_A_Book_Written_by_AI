## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Broken Dam (1,000 words)
**Setting**: Maya's hotel room
**Characters**: Maya
**Purpose**: To depict the raw, unfiltered psychological fallout of the recovered memory.

**Key Events**:
- The chapter opens with Maya in the immediate aftermath of the flashback from Chapter 20. The full, unadulterated memory has returned.
- She is completely overwhelmed. The scene intercuts her present-day reaction with sensory flashes from the past: the smell of the cave, the flat pop of the gunshot, the cold look in her mother's eyes, the feeling of the wooden bird in her hand.
- She experiences a full-blown panic attack, a visceral, physical reaction to the now-unburied trauma. This is the breakdown her parents tried to "fix" 25 years ago.
- She finds the small, carved wooden bird—the one from her evidence box, the one Ethan gave her—and clutches it. It's the one solid thing in a world that has completely shattered.
- The scene is internal and intense, focusing on her psychological state and the pain of a 25-year-old wound that is now fresh.

**Emotional Beats**:
- Overwhelming grief for Tommy and young Sarah.
- A profound sense of betrayal by her own parents.
- The terror of reliving the event with adult understanding.
- A slow, dawning resolve that grows from the pain.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Mostly internal monologue. Fragmented sentences. Sensory details.
- "The sound. It wasn't loud. Why did I think it would be loud?"
- "She looked away. My mother. She just... looked away."
- "Remember. He said, 'Remember.'"

### Scene 2: The Last Clue (800 words)
**Setting**: Maya's hotel room
**Characters**: Maya, Agent Martinez
**Purpose**: To pivot from emotional processing to the final investigation.

**Key Events**:
- After the panic subsides, a cold, clear focus takes its place. Martinez, alerted by a missed check-in call, comes to her room.
- He finds her not hysterical, but eerily calm, holding the wooden bird.
- She tells him everything. The full, complete memory. She tells him about Ethan.
- "Fairchild was right," she says. "There was another one. The one who remembered everything. He's the one who hired me. He's been playing a 25-year-long game."
- She shows Martinez the bird. It's the only clue they have to the identity of their true client.

**Emotional Beats**:
- The shift from raw emotion to icy, professional focus.
- Martinez's awe and horror as he hears the full story.
- The transformation of the wooden bird from a personal memento to a key piece of evidence.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Maya: "His name was Ethan. He was twelve. He saw it all, and he got away. He's been out there all this time, planning this. He put all the pieces on the board—me, the Morrisons, the FBI. And now he's waiting for us to make the final move."
- Martinez: "So we're not just solving a murder anymore. We're finding a ghost."

### Scene 3: The Search for Ethan (1,200 words)
**Setting**: FBI Field Office War Room
**Characters**: Maya, Martinez, Agent Kim, FBI team
**Purpose**: To begin the practical work of finding a man who has been a ghost for 25 years.

**Key Events**:
- The team regroups at the office. The new mission is clear: Find Ethan.
- They have no last name. They only have his age (12) from 25 years ago, and his connection to the "special program."
- They start with the list of 23 victims. He's not on it. This means his parents must have pulled him out of the program immediately after the incident, before he was officially "processed" by Richard.
- Maya focuses on the wooden bird. It's carved from driftwood, but the style is distinctive. She asks for a wood expert.
- Kim's team starts a massive data search: looking for any family that was associated with the Blackwood Foundation 25 years ago who had a 12-year-old son and who abruptly severed ties.
- They cross-reference this with school records, property deeds, anything that could link a family to the island that summer.

**Emotional Beats**:
- The energy of a new hunt, a final, clear objective.
- The frustration of having so little to go on.
- Maya's leadership is now unquestioned. She is the expert in the room.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Kim: "It's a needle in a haystack the size of New England. We're looking for a family that *didn't* become victims."
- Maya: "Look for the opposite. Look for a family that fought back. Check for lawsuits against the Foundation, no matter how frivolous. Look for a family that ran."

### Scene 4: A Signature in the Wood (500 words)
**Setting**: FBI Forensics Lab
**Characters**: Maya, Martinez, a wood expert
**Purpose**: To get the first concrete lead on Ethan's identity.

**Key Events**:
- The wood expert analyzes the carved bird. The wood is common driftwood. But the carving style is unique.
- The expert identifies it as a style of folk art specific to a small, isolated community in Nova Scotia, known for its artisan woodworkers.
- The expert points out a tiny, almost invisible carver's mark on the bird's tail. A stylized "R."
- Suddenly, Kim calls from the war room. He's found something. A family named **Renault**. The father, a French-Canadian, was a consultant for a Blackwood shipping interest. They had a 12-year-old son named Ethan. They spent one summer on the island and left abruptly, breaking a contract and threatening legal action before suddenly going silent.
- The Renault family was originally from that exact region in Nova Scotia.

**Emotional Beats**:
- The thrill of the first real lead.
- The convergence of forensic science and data analysis.
- The name. Finally, the ghost has a name: Ethan Renault.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Wood Expert: "This isn't just whittling. This is a specific tradition. See the way the wings are shaped? That's classic Lunenburg style."
- Kim (over comms): "I've got a possible match. Family name Renault. Son's name, Ethan. Father was a consultant from Nova Scotia. They vanished off the grid a week after Tommy Morrison's death."
- Maya, looking at the "R" on the bird: "Renault. We found him."
