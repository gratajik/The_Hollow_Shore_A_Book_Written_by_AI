**Maya's Professional Pushback**:
"Dr. Blackwood, I'm a licensed investigator, not your patient. If you're concerned about my mental state, I suggest you document your concerns through proper channels."

**Eleanor's Aristocratic Intimidation**:
"Ms. Chen, I think you've misunderstood your role here. You were hired to provide closure, not to disrupt our family with wild theories and accusations."

**James's Near-Breakdown**:
"She was trying to tell me something about when she was little, about the other children, but I thought... I thought she was just confused because of her medication..."
