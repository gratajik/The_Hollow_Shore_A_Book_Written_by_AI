**Key Events**:
- Martinez preps Maya, warning her that Richard is a master manipulator and will try to get under her skin.
- Maya insists on being in the room, not just observing. She argues her presence is the only leverage they have. Martinez reluctantly agrees, with strict protocols in place.
- Dr. Richard is brought in. He is calm, composed, and appears more like a visiting consultant than a prisoner. He smiles warmly at Maya.
- He dismisses his lawyer, stating he wishes to speak with Maya directly, "therapist to therapist," a calculated move to frame the encounter on his terms.

**Emotional Beats**:
- Maya's cold, focused resolve, masking the turmoil from the call with her parents.
- Martinez's protective concern for Maya.
- Dr. Richard's unnerving, charismatic calm.
- The palpable tension in the room as the two adversaries face each other.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Martinez's warnings: "He's going to use everything he knows about you, Maya."
- Maya's response: "I know. That's why I have to be in there. He's not just a suspect to me. I'm not just an agent to him."

### Scene 2: The Doctrine of Preservation (1,500 words)
**Setting**: Interrogation Room
**Characters**: Maya, Dr. Richard Blackwood
**Purpose**: To have Dr. Richard lay out his full, horrifying philosophy.

**Key Events**:
- Richard begins by calmly explaining his "work." He doesn't see it as abuse, but as "preservation."
- He argues that he was saving children from the inevitable trauma and corruption of adulthood, preserving their "perfect, innocent state."
- He uses pseudo-scientific and philosophical language to justify his methods, referencing his paper on "Therapeutic Memory Modification."
- He details the "Integration Suite" not as a place of horror, but as a sanctuary where a child's consciousness could be "archived" at its peak.
- He tries to reframe Tommy Morrison's murder as a "tragic but necessary surgical procedure" to remove a "corrupting influence" that threatened the other "specimens."
- He attempts to draw Maya in, praising her "resilient" and "fascinating" mind, treating her as a peer who should understand his grand vision.

**Emotional Beats**:
- Maya's struggle to maintain professional composure while listening to the man who destroyed her childhood justify his actions.
- The chilling horror of his calm, rational, and utterly insane logic.
- A dawning understanding for Maya that he is not just a criminal, but a true believer in his own monstrous ideology.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Dr. Richard's monologue: "Adulthood is a disease, Maya. A slow, grinding erosion of everything pure. I wasn't destroying children. I was saving them from that fate. I was offering them an eternity of perfect, unsullied innocence."
- His justification for murder: "Tommy was a contamination. He had to be excised to save the integrity of the whole."
- His appeal to Maya: "You, of all people, should understand the desire to edit the past, to remove the painful parts."

### Scene 3: The Victim's Weapon (1,400 words)
**Setting**: Interrogation Room
**Characters**: Maya, Dr. Richard Blackwood
**Purpose**: Maya turns the tables, using her own experience to dismantle his arguments and extract information.

**Key Events**:
- Maya stops him, not with anger, but with a quiet, detailed memory. She describes the feeling of the sensory deprivation tank, the smell of the antiseptic, the specific words he used.
- She doesn't accuse; she states facts from her perspective as a victim. This shifts the power dynamic from a philosophical debate to a direct testimony.
- She asks him about the other children by name, describing their talents and personalities, humanizing the "specimens" he talks about.
- She brings up "Project Nightingale" and Mr. Alistair, asking how selling his "preserved consciousnesses" to other collectors fit into his noble vision.
- This is the first time he shows genuine anger. His mask slips, and he reveals the network is a society of wealthy connoisseurs who pay for his "art."
- He reveals that the most valuable "specimens" were those with strong artistic or intellectual gifts, and that Sarah was to be his masterpiece.

**Emotional Beats**:
- A major shift in power as Maya's personal testimony pierces Richard's intellectual armor.
- Richard's frustration and anger as he loses control of the narrative.
- Maya's quiet strength as she forces him to confront the human reality of his crimes.
- The sickening revelation of the commercial, transactional nature of the "Collectors' Circle."

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Maya's testimony: "You told me to forget the sound of the waves. You said the water was a bad memory. But I remember the salt on my skin. I remember Sarah holding my hand. That's what you took."
- Her questions: "What about Emma Washington's drawings? Was that an impurity you needed to preserve? Or Lucas Chen's love for astronomy?"
- Richard's angry outburst: "They're not just collectors! They are patrons! They understand that what I create is art. A gallery of perfect souls!"

### Scene 4: The Final Gambit (500 words)

**Key Events**:

- He implies that her father's confession was a self-serving lie and that the truth of why they sent her to him is much darker.

- Martinez's fierce protectiveness of Maya.
- The unresolved question of her parents' true motives hangs in the air.

**Dialogue Focus**:
- Richard's final words: "Your father told you they were scared. It's a sweet story. But fear is rarely the whole truth, is it, Maya? Ask me again when you're ready to hear what they really wanted to 'fix' in you."
- Martinez's angry intervention: "This interview is over. Get him out of here."

## Character Development

### Maya Chen
- **Growth**: Faces her abuser directly and uses her trauma as a weapon for justice, demonstrating immense strength.
- **Challenge**: Enduring Richard's psychological attacks while holding onto her professional focus and her own sanity.

- **Setback**: Is left with a new, poisonous doubt about her parents' motivations.

### Dr. Richard Blackwood
- **Revelation**: His full philosophy is revealed as a twisted, self-serving ideology that frames him as a savior, not a monster.
- **Weakness**: His intellectual pride. He cannot resist the urge to explain his "genius," which leads him to reveal key information. His composure breaks when his narrative is challenged by personal testimony.
- **Motivation**: A god complex, a desire for control, and a commercial enterprise disguised as a noble cause.

## Plot Advancement
- The motive and structure of the "Collectors' Circle" are clarified: they are wealthy patrons buying "preserved" consciousnesses.

## Thematic Elements
- **The Banality of Evil**: Richard's calm, rational explanations for his monstrous acts.

- **The Power of Testimony**: Maya's personal, factual account of her experience is the only thing that can cut through Richard's philosophical justifications.

## Transition Notes
**From Chapter 14**: Moves from the initial aftermath to the core psychological confrontation of the investigation.
**To Chapter 16**: Maya will have to process the fallout from the interrogation and the new doubts about her parents, while the FBI begins acting on the intelligence she gathered.
